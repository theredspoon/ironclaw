# Engine v2 → Reborn Capability Parity

**Status:** Validation record — parity evidence for removing engine v2.
**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Purpose:** Prove that every capability the interim **engine v2** architecture
(`crates/ironclaw_engine` + `src/bridge/`, gated behind `ENGINE_V2`, default
off) provided has a home in the **Reborn** architecture
(`crates/ironclaw_runner*` + the neutral contract crates, shipped as the
standalone `ironclaw-reborn` binary). This document is the justification for
deleting engine v2 from the codebase.

## Source of Evidence

Engine v2 (`crates/ironclaw_engine`, `src/bridge/`) and the Reborn crates
(`crates/ironclaw_runner*` plus the neutral contract crates) **coexist on
`main`**, so every path cited below — contract docs under
`docs/reborn/contracts/`, Reborn crates under `crates/`, and the
`tests/reborn_*.rs` / crate-local `tests/` suites — is present and verifiable on
the same tree this document is committed to. All paths are repo-relative. This
parity record is the justification attached to the engine-v2 removal change.

## Summary

Engine v2 was an **interim** unification step: it collapsed ~10 legacy
abstractions (Session, Job, Routine, Channel, Tool, Skill, Hook, Observer,
Extension, LoopDelegate) into five primitives (Thread, Step, Capability,
MemoryDoc, Project) behind three host-implemented traits (`LlmBackend`,
`Store`, `EffectExecutor`). It was never the default runtime and never reached
product completeness. Reborn is the **target** architecture and is *fully
independent* of engine v2 — it does not depend on `ironclaw_engine`, and its
kernel/host-runtime boundary re-derives the same primitives from first
principles as narrow, individually-tested contract crates. Because engine v2 is
gated off (`ENGINE_V2` default false) and Reborn does not import it, removing
engine v2 changes no shipping behavior; the only question this document answers
is whether Reborn is a *superset* of engine v2's capability surface. The matrix
below shows every engine-v2 capability maps to a Reborn contract + crate +
tests, with two capabilities honestly marked **Partial** (the in-loop
Monty/RLM CodeAct orchestrator, and per-action reliability/estimation
tracking) — both of which were themselves incomplete or non-production in
engine v2 and are intentionally reshaped or deferred in Reborn.

## Capability Parity Matrix

Legend: **Covered** = Reborn has an equivalent contract, crate, and test
evidence; **Partial** = an equivalent exists but with a scoped delta noted;
**Gap** = no direct equivalent.

## Notes

1. **Memory (Covered).** The `MemoryService` contract and native provider carry
   the full document lifecycle and hybrid retrieval that engine v2's
   `MemoryStore`/`RetrievalEngine` provided. The
   legacy-vs-reborn comparison (`docs/internal/2026-06-26-legacy-vs-reborn-feature-comparison.md`,
   "Memory/workspace" row) notes that not every *legacy product* memory UX is
   carried over — that is a legacy-product delta, not an engine-v2 primitive
   delta. The `MemoryDoc` primitive itself (typed durable docs incl. skills) is
   fully represented.

2. **Missions / learning missions (Partial).** Engine v2's `MissionManager`
   bundled two concerns: (a) cadence-driven goal execution and (b) four
   event-driven learning missions that auto-fire on thread completion. Reborn
   splits these cleanly — `ironclaw_triggers` owns scheduled cadence (routed
   through the normal turn pipeline), and `ironclaw_skills::learning` owns
   skill extraction/repair. Marked **Partial** because: the automatic
   post-completion firing of *all four* learning missions is not yet a single
   wired-up manager, and the comparison doc's "Automation/routines" and
   "Notable Gaps → Automation production readiness" rows flag external result
   delivery, readiness policy, active-run retention, and jitter as open
   follow-ups. The underlying primitives (scheduled fire, learning
   distill/refine) exist and are tested.

3. **Approvals (Covered, with a tracked epic).** The gate/approval/resume
   architecture is fully present and tested. The comparison doc marks product
   approval *parity* as an ongoing epic (#4539), and the cutover closeout
   (`docs/reborn/production-cutover-readiness-closeout.md`) records that #3026
   covers production wiring for approval request/lease stores with fail-closed
   readiness. The engine-v2 *capability* (typed gates, lease resume, deny) is
   covered; residual work is product-UX parity, not a missing primitive.

4. **CodeAct / self-modify (Partial).** This is the most substantive delta.
   Engine v2 Tier 1 embedded a Python interpreter (Monty) inside the loop with
   the RLM pattern: context-as-variables, `llm_query()` recursive subagent
   calls, and compact inter-step output metadata. Reborn does **not** ship an
   equivalent in-loop Monty orchestrator. Instead it provides (a) a native
   script/software execution lane (`ironclaw_scripts`, `RuntimeKind::Script`)
   sandboxed via `ironclaw_process_sandbox`, and (b) an architecture where
   CodeAct is an explicitly *allowed pluggable parent loop family*
   (`contracts/agent-loop-protocol.md`) rather than a hardcoded tier. The most
   valuable RLM sub-feature — recursive subagents — is realized as
   `spawn_subagent` and is tested (`reborn_subagent_spawn_e2e.rs`).
   Correspondingly, engine v2's *self-modify* that patched the Python
   orchestrator/prompt overlays has no analog because there is no Monty
   orchestrator to patch; versioned skill evolution
   (`ironclaw_skills::learning`) carries the durable-knowledge half. Net: the
   engine-v2 CodeAct primitive is reshaped, not reproduced byte-for-byte. This
   is acceptable for removal because engine-v2 CodeAct was itself experimental
   (Tier 1, RLM), never a production default, and the `.claude/rules/tool-evidence.md`
   note records that even its side-effect gating was only a soft nudge, never a
   hard gate.

5. **Sandbox (Covered).** The per-project Docker sandbox is reproduced as typed
   process plans over backend-neutral sandbox backends with hardened command
   construction and fail-closed network-host validation. The comparison doc
   marks production MITM/product wiring as still partial, but the engine-v2
   capability (route filesystem/shell effects through a per-project container)
   is present and tested.

6. **OpenAI-compatible API (Covered for the engine-v2 surface).** Reborn ships
   contract-first, ProductWorkflow-backed Chat Completions and the Responses
   API (create/retrieve/cancel) with opaque-ref/idempotency and
   projection-backed SSE streaming — deliberately *not* reusing the v1
   stateless proxy path. The comparison doc's "OpenAI-compatible API" row
   labels the *broader legacy gateway API* as Missing/Partial in Reborn; that
   refers to the full control-plane API surface, not the Responses/Chat
   ingress that engine v2 exposed, which is present.

7. **ReliabilityTracker (Gap).** Engine v2's per-action EMA success-rate and
   latency tracker has no dedicated Reborn equivalent; `ironclaw_observability`
   is currently a minimal single-file event/metric sink. This is a low-impact
   gap: the tracker was an internal heuristic feeding capability selection, not
   a user-facing capability, and it has no persisted-contract or wire surface
   that removal of engine v2 would strand. If per-action reliability weighting
   is desired in Reborn it should be a new observability/estimation slice, not
   a blocker for engine-v2 removal.

## Known Gaps / Follow-ups

The only items that are not **Covered** are:

- **CodeAct in-loop Monty/RLM orchestrator** — Partial (note 4). Reshaped into
  a pluggable loop family + native script lane + `spawn_subagent`. No durable
  contract stranded by removal.
- **Unified learning-mission auto-firing** — Partial (note 2). Primitives exist
  (`ironclaw_triggers`, `ironclaw_skills::learning`); orchestration + automation
  production readiness are tracked in the comparison doc's "Notable Gaps →
  Automation production readiness".
- **Per-action ReliabilityTracker (EMA)** — Gap (note 7). Internal heuristic
  with no wire/contract surface; safe to drop or re-introduce as a new
  observability slice.

These correspond to entries in the "Notable Gaps Before Reborn Can Replace
Legacy" section of
`docs/internal/2026-06-26-legacy-vs-reborn-feature-comparison.md` (Automation
production readiness; Model/provider feature parity) and to the residual epics
noted in `docs/reborn/production-cutover-readiness-closeout.md` (#4539
approvals parity, #3029 migration). Critically, **none of these gaps are
engine-v2-specific**: they are Reborn-vs-legacy-product deltas that exist
independently of whether engine v2 is present, because engine v2 is gated off
and no shipping path depends on it.

## Conclusion

Every one of engine v2's five primitives (Thread, Step, Capability, MemoryDoc,
Project) and every runtime concern it layered on top (missions,
gates/approvals, sandbox, OpenAI-compatible Responses API, skills/hooks/
extensions, effect dispatch, events/projections, the `LlmBackend`/`Store`/
`EffectExecutor`/`WorkspaceReader` trait boundaries) maps to a named Reborn
contract, one or more dedicated crates, and passing test evidence. Two
capabilities are honestly **Partial** and one is a **Gap** — all three are
internal/experimental engine-v2 features (in-loop Monty CodeAct, unified
learning-mission firing, EMA reliability tracking) with no durable contract,
wire format, or shipping code path that engine-v2 removal would strand.

Because engine v2 is default-off (`ENGINE_V2` false) and Reborn is fully
independent of `ironclaw_engine`, deleting engine v2 removes only dead-by-default
interim code. **Engine v2 can be safely removed.** The recommended follow-ups
(CodeAct loop family productionization, unified learning-mission wiring, and an
optional reliability/estimation observability slice) are net-new Reborn work,
not regressions caused by the removal.
