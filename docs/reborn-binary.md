# `ironclaw-reborn` standalone binary

`ironclaw-reborn` is the standalone executable boundary for Reborn. It is separate from the current `ironclaw` binary so Reborn boot, config, state, and runtime composition can evolve without accidentally invoking v1 runtime paths.

This binary is available as the workspace package `ironclaw_reborn_cli` and builds the executable named `ironclaw-reborn`.

## Current status

`ironclaw-reborn` is an early operator/testing surface, not the default IronClaw runtime.

It currently supports:

```bash
ironclaw-reborn --help
ironclaw-reborn completion --shell bash
ironclaw-reborn completion --shell zsh
ironclaw-reborn doctor
ironclaw-reborn run
```

It intentionally does not yet support:

- replacing `ironclaw` behavior;
- daemon/service installation;
- web gateway/UI startup;
- v1 config, DB, settings, or secrets migration;
- production extension/tool execution;
- long-lived Reborn runtime services.

## Commands

### `completion`

Generates shell completion scripts without resolving Reborn home, reading v1 state, or creating directories.

```bash
cargo run -q -p ironclaw_reborn_cli --bin ironclaw-reborn -- completion --shell zsh > ironclaw-reborn.zsh
cargo run -q -p ironclaw_reborn_cli --bin ironclaw-reborn -- completion --shell bash > ironclaw-reborn.bash
```

The zsh output keeps the v1 CLI guard around `compdef` so the generated script is safe when zsh completion functions are not loaded yet.

### `doctor`

Validates and reports Reborn boot configuration without creating state directories or starting runtime services.

```bash
cargo run -q -p ironclaw_reborn_cli --bin ironclaw-reborn -- doctor
```

Expected fields include:

- `reborn_home`
- `home_source`
- `profile`
- `v1_state: not-used`
- `driver_registry: initialized`

### `run`

Initializes the minimal Reborn runtime shell and exits successfully. This is a smokeable composition shell, not full agent execution.

```bash
cargo run -q -p ironclaw_reborn_cli --bin ironclaw-reborn -- run
```

Expected fields include:

- `binary: ironclaw-reborn`
- `version`
- `reborn_home`
- `home_source`
- `profile`
- `v1_state: not-used`
- `driver_registry: initialized`
- `runtime_shell: initialized`

## State and config root

Reborn must not use the current v1 IronClaw state root by default.

Home resolution precedence:

1. `IRONCLAW_REBORN_HOME`
2. `~/.ironclaw/reborn`

The resolver rejects unsafe or misleading homes, including empty paths, relative paths, filesystem root, parent-directory components, and known v1 state-root aliases such as `$HOME/.ironclaw` or `IRONCLAW_BASE_DIR`.

## Profiles

Use `IRONCLAW_REBORN_PROFILE` to select the boot profile.

Supported values:

- `local-dev` (default)
- `production`
- `migration-dry-run`

Example:

```bash
IRONCLAW_REBORN_HOME="$PWD/.reborn-home" \
IRONCLAW_REBORN_PROFILE=production \
cargo run -q -p ironclaw_reborn_cli --bin ironclaw-reborn -- doctor
```

## Local smoke checks

Run these before changing Reborn CLI behavior:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test -p ironclaw_reborn_cli
cargo test -p ironclaw_reborn_config
cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture reborn
cargo clippy -p ironclaw_reborn_cli --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo run -q -p ironclaw_reborn_cli --bin ironclaw-reborn -- --help
cargo run -q -p ironclaw_reborn_cli --bin ironclaw-reborn -- completion --shell zsh >/tmp/ironclaw-reborn.zsh
IRONCLAW_REBORN_HOME="$(mktemp -d)/reborn-home" \
  cargo run -q -p ironclaw_reborn_cli --bin ironclaw-reborn -- run
```

## Adding commands

Future commands should follow the crate-local agent contract in:

```text
crates/ironclaw_reborn_cli/AGENTS.md
```

Short version:

1. add one command module under `crates/ironclaw_reborn_cli/src/commands/`;
2. register it in `commands::Command`;
3. resolve and pass `RebornCliContext` from dispatch only when the command needs boot config;
4. keep pure commands independent from Reborn home resolution;
5. add a binary smoke test through `env!("CARGO_BIN_EXE_ironclaw-reborn")`;
6. avoid v1 runtime imports and v1 state mutation unless explicitly scoped and guarded.

Do not port the current `src/cli/*` command tree wholesale. Port commands one at a time, starting with Reborn-owned or read-only surfaces.

## Release packaging decision

`ironclaw-reborn` is **not yet included in cargo-dist release artifacts**.

Current `dist plan --output-format=json` with `crates/ironclaw_reborn_cli` marked `dist = false` emits only the root `ironclaw` package artifacts. Removing `dist = false` alone is not enough to ship `ironclaw-reborn` in the existing `ironclaw-v*` release workflow because that workflow is shaped around the root `ironclaw` package tag. Enabling a standalone `ironclaw_reborn_cli` release also requires cargo-dist WiX metadata/template work and an explicit tag/versioning decision.

Follow-up issue: #3483 tracks packaging `ironclaw-reborn` in release artifacts.

Until #3483 is resolved, keep:

```toml
[package.metadata.dist]
dist = false
```

in `crates/ironclaw_reborn_cli/Cargo.toml` so releases do not silently claim to ship an unverified Reborn binary package.
