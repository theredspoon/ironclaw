# Trigger Loop and Delivery Resolution — Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Status:** Draft — reviewed by codebase subagents, pending owner decisions
**Branch:** reborn-integration
**Primary specs:**
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-21-trigger-loop-design.md`
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-channel-communication-delivery-resolution.md`

## Goal

Implement communication delivery resolution and scheduled trigger loops in
small, reviewable PRs. Each PR should target fewer than 1000 lines of code where
practical, merge before the next dependent slice, and preserve Reborn ownership
boundaries.

Delivery resolution and trigger trusted-ingress are separate early contract
tracks. Delivery resolution is required before user-visible trigger delivery,
but it is not required before the trigger loop can fire, run through the Reborn
turn path, and persist a thread. If product outbound is not ready when trigger
V1 lands, V1 acceptance is: cron trigger fires, submits a synthetic inbound turn
through trusted ingress, runs in a dedicated thread, and persists the result.

## Current Ground Truth

- Work targets `reborn-integration`, not `staging`.
- `ironclaw_outbound` owns outbound policy, reply-target validation, delivery
  attempts, and thread notification policy.
- `OutboundPolicyService::prepare_delivery_attempt` currently has contract-test
  coverage but no production orchestration caller.
- Existing outbound policy is thread-scoped. User-level delivery preferences do
  not exist yet; the existing `src/profile.rs::CommunicationPreferences` is
  unrelated profile/tone data.
- Product workflow is primarily inbound. Product adapters own transport
  rendering through `ProductAdapter::render_outbound`; host/composition glue
  must own the policy sequence before adapter render.
- `ironclaw_conversations::InboundTurnService` owns inbound replay, binding
  resolution, message acceptance, and turn submission. Trigger ingress must
  extend this service rather than duplicate the pipeline.
- `ConversationBindingService` already exposes
  `resolve_or_create_binding_with_trusted_scope`, but `InboundTurnService` does
  not yet expose a trusted inbound facade.
- `AdapterKind` and `ExternalConversationRef` are publicly constructible
  bounded values today, so a reserved string alone is not enough to seal
  host-internal trigger ingress from product adapters.
- `ironclaw_triggers` does not exist yet.
- Runtime composition currently owns one turn-runner worker handle; adding a
  trigger poller needs explicit multi-worker startup/shutdown ownership.
- Trigger delivery must not smuggle communication destinations through
  `ExternalConversationRef`, `TurnActor`, `adapter_kind`, or trigger ingress
  identity.

## Owner Decisions Before PR 1

These decisions are now locked for the first implementation pass; the two doc
PRs should record them as contract language.

1. PR 1 and PR 2 are parallel contract tracks. If we choose a single first PR,
   prioritize PR 2 because trusted ingress is the hard prerequisite for trigger
   execution.
2. Trigger fires need a host-internal ingress representation that product
   adapters cannot construct. The contract must define deterministic
   `adapter_kind`, `external_actor_ref`, `external_conversation_ref`, and
   `external_event_id` values, but not rely on a raw reserved string alone for
   trust.
3. Trusted trigger scope flows through
   `handle_inbound_turn_with_trusted_scope` parameters. Synthetic trigger
   requests should not carry normal untrusted requested scope hints as the
   authority source.
4. V1 `TriggerRunStatus` stays synchronous: `Ok` means submitted, `Error` means
   submission failed. `ApprovalBlocked` and `TimedOut` are fast-follow unless a
   later PR explicitly wires turn-lifecycle observation.
5. Communication preferences are database-backed from day one, using a
   dedicated typed tenant/user communication-preference table/repository rather
   than the generic JSON settings store.
6. Host/composition owns
   `CommunicationDeliveryCandidate -> prepare_delivery_attempt -> render_outbound`.
   Product adapters keep transport rendering ownership and do not perform
   outbound policy lookup.
7. Trigger prompt materialization uses a narrow port/helper. `ironclaw_triggers`
   asks for an inbound content ref and does not reach into composition, product
   adapters, or transcript internals directly.
8. V1 active-run back-pressure is required:
   `max_concurrent_fires_per_trigger = 1`. A trigger skips a tick while its
   previous fire is still active.
9. `trigger_create`, `trigger_list`, and `trigger_remove` are required
   user-facing first-party capabilities, registered through the
   composition-owned first-party registry and available in local-dev and
   production.
10. Trigger poll settings are composition-owned, and V1 schedules must reject
    sub-minute cadence. No trigger may fire more frequently than once per
    minute.
11. Trigger result delivery remains fast-follow until a concrete outbound
    adapter path is named and proven ready with target validation, envelope
    construction, delivery-attempt recording, and caller-level tests.
12. Requested outbound is not allowed to bypass authority-bearing prompt
    policy. Approval/auth prompt delivery must resolve through exact-owner
    prompt targets first; requested outbound may only apply to ordinary
    non-authority delivery or narrow to the same exact-owner prompt target.

## Dependency DAG

Trigger event execution does **not** need delivery resolution. The trigger loop
can ship once trusted ingress, trigger storage, the poller, and composition
wiring are complete. Delivery resolution is only required for pushing the final
trigger result to an external product/channel.

Parallelization notes:

- PR 1 and PR 2 are independent doc/contract tracks and can be prepared in
  parallel. If we want a single first PR, choose PR 2 first when optimizing for
  trigger execution, or PR 1 first when optimizing for outbound delivery.
- After PR 1 merges, PR 3 can proceed without waiting for PR 2.
- After PR 2 merges, PR 8 can proceed without waiting for delivery work.
- PR 4 and PR 8 can run in parallel because they touch different crates and
  solve different prerequisites.
- PR 5/6/7 are delivery-only. They do not block PR 9 through PR 16 unless the
  chosen milestone is "trigger result is pushed externally" rather than
  "trigger event fires and creates a persisted thread."
- PR 10 and PR 11 are serial if PR 11 is the parity backend, but they can be
  reversed if backend ownership prefers implementing libSQL first or PostgreSQL
  first.
- PR 15 and PR 16 can start from the same post-PR14 baseline, but they should
  merge carefully because both need repository/config wiring from composition.
- PR 17 should remain fast-follow until PR 7 is merged and a concrete outbound
  adapter path is declared ready.

Milestone gates:

- **Trigger event MVP:** PR 2, PR 8, PR 9, PR 10, PR 11, PR 12, PR 13, PR 14,
  and PR 16. PR 15 is required if the MVP includes user-facing `trigger_*`
  management rather than seeded/test-created triggers.
- **User-managed trigger MVP:** Trigger event MVP plus PR 15.
- **Externally delivered trigger result:** User-managed trigger MVP plus PR 1,
  PR 3, PR 4, PR 5, PR 6, PR 7, and PR 17.

## PR Sequence

### PR 1 — Delivery Contract

Promote the delivery-resolution design into Reborn contracts before code:

- Add or update the delivery-resolution contract under `docs/reborn/contracts/`.
- Update `events-projections.md` with where communication resolution plugs into
  event/projection/outbound flow.
- Update `approvals.md` to state that approval notification is separate from
  approval resolution and leases.
- Update auth/product runtime contracts to state that auth prompt notification
  is separate from auth-flow creation, callback handling, credential exchange,
  and token storage.
- Update `conversation-binding.md` to keep reply-target binding semantics
  distinct from synthetic trigger ingress identity.
- Define the typed resolution envelope, preference fields, and deterministic P0
  order before implementation so PR 3 and PR 5 do not reinterpret prompt
  authority, trigger/source-route precedence, or system-event behavior.

Expected size: docs only.

### PR 2 — Trigger Trusted-Ingress Contract

Ratify trigger-specific contract changes before code:

- Add host-trusted inbound ingress semantics to `conversation-binding.md`.
- Define `InboundTurnService::handle_inbound_turn_with_trusted_scope`.
- Define every synthetic `InboundTurnRequest` field used by trigger fires:
  `adapter_kind`, `external_actor_ref`, `external_conversation_ref`,
  `external_event_id`, route kind, actor, content ref, and scope flow.
- Specify that host-internal ingress values are type-sealed or otherwise
  unconstructible by product adapters, not merely conventional reserved strings.
- Add a trigger-system contract covering `TriggerRecord`,
  `TriggerSourceProvider`, `TriggerFireIdentity`, poller semantics,
  deterministic-slot idempotency, and scope rules.
- Decide whether post-run `ApprovalBlocked` / `TimedOut` status updates are V1
  or fast-follow.
- State the V1 schedule granularity rule: cron and other schedule providers
  must reject schedules that can fire more frequently than once per minute.

Expected size: docs only.

### PR 3 — Outbound Resolver Domain Types

Add typed request/response shapes in `ironclaw_outbound`:

- `CommunicationDeliveryResolutionRequest`
- `CommunicationDeliveryIntent`
- `CommunicationDeliveryKind`
- `RunNotificationEventKind`
- `RunNotificationOrigin`
- `RequestedOutboundContext`
- `SourceRouteContext`
- `TriggerCommunicationContext`
- `CommunicationModality`
- `CommunicationDeliveryCandidate`
- delivery target capability types
- translation notes to existing `OutboundPushCandidate` /
  `PrepareOutboundDeliveryRequest`

`RequestedOutboundContext` must carry a typed `ReplyTargetBindingRef` candidate,
not a raw adapter/channel/conversation string. The top-level request must carry
the delivery kind so validation can reject shared/group widening for
authority-bearing prompt payloads.

Include serde and unit tests. Do not wire product egress yet.

Expected size: less than 700 lines.

### PR 4 — Communication Preferences DB Model

Add user delivery preferences owned by `ironclaw_outbound` and persisted in a
dedicated typed database table/repository:

- final replies target
- progress target
- approval prompt target
- auth prompt target
- default modality
- tenant/user composite identity
- updated timestamp and updater identity

Stored `ReplyTargetBindingRef` values are candidates only and must be
revalidated at send time. Do not reuse the existing profile/TOML config path or
the generic DB-backed JSON settings store as the source of truth; those are
operator/user-settings shaped and not tenant/user typed delivery policy.
Imitate the DB store pattern where useful, but keep communication preferences a
typed outbound-owned repository.

The repository fields should map directly to the delivery contract names:
`final_reply_target`, `progress_target`, `approval_prompt_target`,
`auth_prompt_target`, and `default_modality`.

Expected size: less than 1000 lines. If PostgreSQL + libSQL parity pushes past
the line budget, split this into model/trait + first backend, then second
backend/parity before PR 5.

### PR 5 — Outbound Resolution Engine

Implement `OutboundResolutionEngine` as a deterministic, host-owned P0 rule
engine after database-backed preferences exist:

1. Authority-bearing approval/auth prompts use exact-owner prompt targets.
2. Explicit requested outbound wins only for non-authority delivery kinds.
3. Live inbound loops reply to their source route for ordinary notifications.
4. Triggered-from-source-route origins prefer the live source route.
5. Triggered loops without a live source route use the creator user's
   configured `final_reply_target`.
6. System-event origins require an explicit requested outbound target for
   external delivery; otherwise they record metadata only.

The engine returns a candidate only. It must not mutate inbound state, approval
state, auth state, pending gates, transcript state, or delivery attempts. If
the selected target is missing or revoked, P0 fails closed; no implicit fallback.

Expected size: less than 900 lines.

### PR 6 — Outbound Validation Bridge

Connect resolved candidates to existing outbound validation without touching
adapter transport rendering:

- Convert `CommunicationDeliveryCandidate` into the existing
  `OutboundPushCandidate` / `PrepareOutboundDeliveryRequest` path.
- Ensure every candidate flows through
  `OutboundPolicyService::prepare_delivery_attempt`.
- Add caller-level tests for requested outbound, live source-route final reply,
  triggered default target, triggered-from-source-route precedence, system-event
  no-target behavior, prompt exact-owner enforcement, and revoked target
  failure.

Expected size: less than 1000 lines.

### PR 7 — Product Outbound Orchestration

Wire the host/composition-side outbound orchestration point that currently
builds product outbound envelopes:

- Own the sequence
  `resolve candidate -> prepare delivery attempt -> adapter render_outbound`.
- Keep `ProductAdapter::render_outbound` as transport rendering, not policy
  lookup.
- Name the concrete first path being wired and keep adapter-specific behavior
  behind adapter capability/validation boundaries.

Expected size: less than 1000 lines; split if this touches both composition
and adapter call sites heavily.

### PR 8 — Trusted Inbound Facade

Implement `InboundTurnService::handle_inbound_turn_with_trusted_scope` in
`ironclaw_conversations` after PR 2:

- Keep replay lookup first, exactly like `handle_inbound_turn`, so duplicate
  scheduled-slot retries hit existing inbound idempotency.
- Route fresh binding resolution through
  `resolve_or_create_binding_with_trusted_scope`.
- Reuse the existing accept and submit path.
- Add a caller-level test double that fails if `resolve_or_create_binding` is
  called, proving the trusted method is actually used.
- Add replay coverage proving duplicate trusted inbound avoids double
  submission.

Expected size: less than 500 lines.

### PR 9 — `ironclaw_triggers` Crate Skeleton

Add the trigger crate with domain and in-memory behavior:

- workspace-member registration
- architecture-boundary test updates for the new crate
- `TriggerId`
- `TriggerRecord`
- `TriggerSchedule`
- `TriggerSourceKind`
- `TriggerState`
- `TriggerRunStatus`
- `TriggerFire`
- `TriggerFireIdentity`
- `TriggerSourceProvider`
- `TriggerRepository` trait
- cron validation and next-slot computation
- schedule validation rejecting sub-minute fire cadence
- in-memory repository for tests

Include unit tests for schedule validation, serde, and deterministic fire
identity. Include tests proving expressions with sub-minute cadence are
rejected. The workspace already has `cron = "0.13"` available.

Expected size: less than 1000 lines.

### PR 10 — Trigger Persistence, Backend 1

Add the first durable `TriggerRepository` backend:

- migrations/schema for one chosen backend
- composite poller index on `(tenant_id, enabled, state, next_run_at)`
- due-trigger query with limit
- scoped list/remove behavior
- backend-specific tests

Expected size: less than 1000 lines.

### PR 11 — Trigger Persistence, Backend 2 and Parity

Add the second required backend and parity coverage:

- migrations/schema for the second backend
- shared parity tests across both backends
- any schema compatibility fixes from PR 10

Expected size: less than 1000 lines.

### PR 12 — Trigger Materialization and Back-Pressure Seams

Add the narrow ports/helpers the poller needs before the worker implementation:

- deterministic trigger prompt materialization into the inbound content-ref
  model without letting `ironclaw_triggers` reach into composition or product
  adapters.
- active-run counting/back-pressure seam for threads belonging to a trigger.
  V1 policy is exactly one active fire per trigger; later concurrency can be an
  explicit config expansion.
- tests for both seams at the owning crate boundary.

Expected size: less than 800 lines.

### PR 13 — Trigger Poller Core

Implement `TriggerPollerWorker` core logic:

- poll due schedule triggers
- cap fires per tick
- apply per-trigger active-run back-pressure with
  `max_concurrent_fires_per_trigger = 1`
- construct deterministic synthetic `InboundTurnRequest`
- call `handle_inbound_turn_with_trusted_scope`
- persist synchronous submit status and next-run bookkeeping
- preserve replay safety across crash retry or dual poller attempts

Keep post-run async statuses fast-follow unless PR 2 explicitly chooses to wire
the lifecycle observer in V1.

Expected size: less than 1000 lines.

### PR 14 — Trigger Poller Caller-Level Harness

Add the heavier caller-level tests separately from the worker core:

- repository + provider + inbound service + turn coordinator test path
- one new canonical thread per fire
- trusted scope reaches binding resolution
- same scheduled slot replays instead of double-submitting
- active-run back-pressure behavior
- proof that a second due fire is skipped while one fire for the same trigger
  is active

Expected size: less than 1000 lines; split further if the harness grows.

### PR 15 — `trigger_*` First-Party Capabilities

Expose trigger management through the composition-owned first-party capability
registry, not local-dev synthetic capabilities:

- `trigger_create`
- `trigger_list`
- `trigger_remove`
- package/registry declarations
- production wiring checks
- tests that capability IDs are present in both package manifest and registry

Scope must be stamped from invocation context and rechecked on list/remove.
Repository access must be injected through an explicit composition-owned seam;
do not assume `InvocationServices` already carries a trigger repository.

Expected size: less than 1000 lines.

### PR 16 — Trigger Composition and Worker Lifecycle

Wire the trigger poller into Reborn composition:

- config ownership for poll interval, fires per tick, and per-trigger active-run
  cap. V1 default and maximum for per-trigger active fires is 1.
- second background-worker handle or a background-task bundle
- startup/shutdown behavior alongside `TurnRunnerWorker`
- architecture tests for `ironclaw_triggers` dependency edges
- current architecture map update
- `FEATURE_PARITY.md` update with a distinct Reborn trigger-loop note rather
  than relying on legacy cron rows

Expected size: less than 1000 lines; split into config and lifecycle if needed.

### PR 17 — Trigger Delivery Integration Fast-Follow

Only after delivery-resolution PRs are merged and a concrete adapter path is
ready, connect trigger-origin final reply delivery:

- name the first adapter path and readiness gate.
- construct `RunNotificationOrigin::Triggered`.
- construct `RunNotificationOrigin::TriggeredFromSourceRoute` when a trigger
  run also has a live source route, and verify live source route precedence.
- resolve with `OutboundResolutionEngine`.
- validate with `OutboundPolicyService`.
- send only through Reborn product-adapter outbound paths that are ready.

If concrete Reborn product egress is not ready, leave this as fast-follow and
ship trigger V1 as local persisted threads only.

Expected size: less than 1000 lines.

## Review Summary

Five codebase review agents checked the original plan against the current
Reborn code. Their main findings are incorporated above:

- Delivery and trusted ingress should be independent early contract tracks.
- Preference-backed trigger delivery cannot land before a real user delivery
  preference store exists.
- Product adapters should keep transport rendering ownership; host/composition
  should own outbound policy orchestration before render.
- Host-internal trigger ingress must be sealed, not just represented by a
  conventional string value.
- Trigger persistence, poller implementation, and poller integration tests need
  separate PR slices to respect the line budget.
- `trigger_*` belongs on the first-party capability registry path, not the
  local-dev synthetic wrapper.
- Trigger worker lifecycle needs an explicit multi-worker ownership model.
- Communication preferences should be DB-backed from day one as a typed
  tenant/user repository, not stored in legacy profile/TOML config or generic
  JSON settings.
