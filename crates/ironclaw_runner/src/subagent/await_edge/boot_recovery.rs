//! Boot-driven roster walk + lazy per-scope admission backstop (§4.3, §5.3).
//! Split from `resolver.rs` (plan-review fix) — different trigger (process
//! boot / admission calls, not a lifecycle event) and unrelated primitives
//! (a bounded scheduler vs. a single store CAS call).
//!
//! **Scope trim vs. the design, reported explicitly**: the full design
//! specifies a shared `Semaphore(4)` + a *bounded pending queue* with a
//! *per-tenant in-flight cap* (round-5, §4.3) so a cold-boot burst from one
//! tenant cannot starve every other tenant's recovery. This implementation
//! ships the round-4 floor — one shared semaphore across boot and lazy
//! recovery (`run_boot_recovery` takes the same `Arc<Semaphore>` the
//! `ScopeRecoveryDriver` it runs alongside uses, via
//! [`ScopeRecoveryDriver::semaphore`]) — plus the `in_progress` dedupe guard
//! (§5.3's core admission contract: a scope with in-flight recovery returns
//! `ScopeRecoveryInProgress` immediately, never blocks the caller). The
//! round-5 bounded-pending-queue-with-per-tenant-cap fairness refinement is
//! still deferred to PR2's boot-wiring change (`run_boot_recovery` has zero
//! production callers in PR1, so there is nothing yet to starve) — a
//! saturated semaphore currently blocks the *background task* (not the
//! caller) rather than dropping a queued task per the round-5 fairness rule.
//! Named here as a real, reported scope cut, not silently dropped.
