//! Shared, mutex-free compare-and-swap (CAS) read-modify-write helper.
//!
//! IronClaw Reborn persistence stores keep their durable state as a single
//! versioned snapshot per scoped key (e.g. `/turns/state.json`). Mutating that
//! snapshot is a read-modify-write: load the current snapshot + its
//! [`RecordVersion`](crate::RecordVersion), compute the next snapshot, then
//! [`put`](RootFilesystem::put) it back with a
//! `CasExpectation::Version` precondition so a concurrent writer that committed
//! in between is detected as a [`FilesystemError::VersionMismatch`] instead of
//! silently clobbered.
//!
//! Historically each store wrapped that loop in a per-record
//! `tokio::sync::Mutex` held across `.await`. Under burst those locks formed a
//! convoy that wedged the runtime (2026-06-24 incident). PR #5142 removed the
//! mutex from `ironclaw_turns` and proved the lock-free pattern: an optimistic
//! CAS-retry loop with bounded retries, jittered exponential backoff, and an
//! overall timeout. [`cas_update`] extracts that **exact** pattern so every
//! store can drop its mutex onto one audited implementation.
//!
//! ## Contract
//!
//! [`cas_update`] never holds a lock across an `.await`. It runs a bounded
//! read-modify-write loop:
//!
//! 1. Read the current versioned snapshot for `path` (decoding it via the
//!    caller's `decode`, or treating an absent record as `None`).
//! 2. Run the caller's `apply` closure, which computes the next snapshot plus a
//!    caller-defined outcome (`T`) or returns the caller's error (`E`).
//! 3. If the snapshot is unchanged, return the outcome without writing.
//! 4. Otherwise `put` the encoded snapshot back with the read version as the
//!    CAS precondition (`CasExpectation::Absent` for a first write).
//! 5. On [`FilesystemError::VersionMismatch`] re-read and retry, sleeping with
//!    jittered exponential backoff between attempts.
//!
//! The whole loop is wrapped in a [`FILESYSTEM_APPLY_TIMEOUT`] timeout so one
//! wedged backend operation consumes only this caller's attempt rather than
//! parking unrelated callers forever. Retries are capped at
//! [`FILESYSTEM_CAS_RETRIES`]; exceeding the cap returns
//! [`CasUpdateError::RetriesExhausted`] rather than looping indefinitely.
//!
//! ## Constants (ported verbatim from the `ironclaw_turns` reference)
//!
//! - [`FILESYSTEM_CAS_RETRIES`] = 32 — retry cap on `VersionMismatch`.
//! - [`FILESYSTEM_APPLY_TIMEOUT`] = 15s — deadline for the entire loop.
//! - [`FILESYSTEM_CAS_BACKOFF_BASE`] = 2ms — backoff at the first retry.
//! - [`FILESYSTEM_CAS_BACKOFF_MAX`] = 50ms — backoff ceiling.
//!
//! ## Capability gate (fail closed)
//!
//! Before attempting any write, [`cas_update`] asserts the backend can honor
//! compare-and-swap. There are two layers, because the production composite
//! router cannot answer capabilities without a concrete path
//! (see [`ScopedFilesystem::capabilities`]):
//!
//! - **Pre-flight:** if the backend advertises a *known* capability shape
//!   (anything other than the empty default), and that shape does **not**
//!   include [`TxnCapability::Cas`] (or richer), the helper refuses up front
//!   with [`CasUpdateError::CasUnsupported`]. This catches a misconfigured
//!   byte-only mount before it can blind-overwrite a snapshot.
//! - **Op-time:** an empty/unknown capability shape (the composite router)
//!   defers to the write, where an
//!   [`FilesystemError::Unsupported`]`{ operation: WriteFile, .. }` is mapped
//!   to the same [`CasUpdateError::CasUnsupported`]. Either way the helper
//!   fails closed instead of falling back to `CasExpectation::Any`.
//!
//! ## Error mapping
//!
//! The helper is generic over the caller's error type `E` and never leaks a
//! store-specific type. Helper-level failures surface as [`CasUpdateError`];
//! callers convert them into their own error enum with a single mapper closure
//! (`map_err`). The caller's own `apply` error (`E`) is returned unwrapped via
//! [`CasUpdateError::Apply`], so a store maps the whole space in one place.

///     `unchanged_snapshot` equals what `apply` was handed; `cas_update`
///     detects the equality via `PartialEq` and skips the write as a
///     convenience fast path.

/// `S: PartialEq` powers the equality fast path (skip the write when nothing
/// changed); `S: Clone` lets each retry hand `apply` an owned snapshot while the
/// helper retains a copy for that equality check — both mirror the turns
