//! Strategy trait contracts for the Reborn agent loop.
//!
//! Each strategy receives `&LoopExecutionState` and returns an outcome enum
//! that carries the new value of its own slot. The executor swaps the slot
//! into the next whole state. See `docs/reborn/agent-loop-skeleton.md` §6
//! ("Strategy decomposition") and §8 ("Outcome enums").
//!
//! WS-1/2/3 land the alpha, beta, and gamma trait stubs and outcome enums.
//! `Default*` impls land in WS-5; the executor body that consumes these
//! outcomes lands in WS-6.
//!
//! Checkpoint/observability wire enums are `#[non_exhaustive]`; later
//! workstreams should extend them without forcing consumers to assume the
//! current variants are closed.
//!
//! Pure policy traits with no host or future host consult may stay sync.
//! Gate and recovery traits are async because they can consult host/runtime
//! state such as grant history, auth flow status, route health, or
//! circuit-breaker counters.

// WS-1/2/3 land crate-private strategy contracts before WS-4/5/6 compose and
// execute them. Keep the unused lint local to these forward-declared contracts.
