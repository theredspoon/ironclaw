//! Admin API token minting port.

//! Kept in its own module (not feature-gated) so it can appear in the
//! `build_webui_services` signature, which is compiled in builds without the
//! `webui-v2-beta` feature. The trait carries no WebUI/ingress types — just the
//! canonical identifiers and a `SecretString` — so it is dependency-free.

/// serve layer over the session store (a `SignedTokenSessionStore` is stateless
/// and deterministic from the operator secret, so it can be built independently
/// of the ingress auth surface). Abstracted here so composition needs no
/// dependency on the ingress crate.
