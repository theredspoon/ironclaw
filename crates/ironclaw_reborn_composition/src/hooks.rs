//! Production activation of the hook framework.
//!
//! This module is the single composition seam that flips the (otherwise
//! dormant) hook framework into the live capability-invocation path. It owns:
//!
//! 1. **The feature flag** ([`HooksActivationConfig`]) — default OFF. When
//!    OFF, [`build_hook_dispatcher_builder_factory`] returns `None` and the
//!    runtime composes exactly as it did before hooks existed (zero behavior
//!    change). This is the hard rollout-safety contract for the activation.
//! 2. **The first-party builtin hook set** ([`install_first_party_hooks`]) —
//!    installed regardless of extensions. The production catalog is
//!    deliberately **EMPTY**: no real first-party builtin hook has been
//!    productized, so we ship none. A production type + install path + behavior
//!    for a hook that does nothing is scaffolding, not a deliverable. The
//!    activation machinery is exercised end-to-end with test-only hooks (see
//!    the `#[cfg(test)]` `NoOpObserverHook` and the test-only first-party
//!    installer seam below), not with a shipped no-op. An empty first-party set
//!    composed with no extension hooks is a legitimate state — the dispatcher
//!    composes with zero bindings, which is valid (not a panic/error).
//! 3. **The manifest → registry loader** ([`project_extension_install_sets`] +
//!    [`install_extension_sets`]) — projects each declared
//!    [`HookSectionEntryV2`] payload into a typed
//!    [`ironclaw_hooks::manifest::HookManifestEntry`] (the only fallible,
//!    external-input step), then installs them through [`HookRegistrar::install`]
//!    at the `Installed` trust tier. Trust attenuation is enforced by
//!    construction: the registrar only ever calls `install_installed_*`, so an
//!    extension hook can never mint `Allow` / `Gate` / `Mutator` without an
//!    explicit per-extension grant.
//! 4. **The per-run dispatcher builder factory** — a [`HookInstallPlan`]
//!    compiled once (parse + validate the full install set, fail-closed),
//!    returned to the runtime to pass to
//!    `RebornLoopDriverHostFactory::with_hook_dispatcher_builder_factory`. The
//!    factory closure calls [`HookInstallPlan::rebuild`] to mint a *fresh*
//!    [`HookDispatcherBuilder`] per host build (per run), so slot-poisoning and
//!    registry mutations never leak across runs. `rebuild` is infallible **by
//!    construction**: a `HookInstallPlan` only exists for an install set that
//!    already composed cleanly, so replaying it from the identical fresh-empty
//!    start cannot fail (no per-run `.expect()`/`unwrap`). Telemetry
//!    attribution is per-run because the host factory attaches the run-scoped
//!    milestone sink internally to each fresh builder.
//!
//! ## Per-tenant scoping (multi-tenant isolation contract, #3890)
//!
//! `build_reborn_runtime` is invoked once per identity/owner — one
//! `tenant_id` per call. Everything this module constructs (the
//! [`PredicateEvaluator`] + its state backend, the compiled [`HookInstallPlan`],
//! the per-run dispatcher closure) is built inside that per-tenant call, so one
//! tenant's hooks can never apply to another. There is no global registry.
//!
//! ## Predicate counter scoping (TENANT-scoped, deliberately shared across runs)
//!
//! The [`PredicateEvaluator`] and its state backend are constructed **once per
//! runtime/tenant** ([`build_hook_dispatcher_builder_factory_with`]) and the
//! same `Arc<PredicateEvaluator>` is captured into the [`HookInstallPlan`], so
//! every per-run dispatcher minted by [`HookInstallPlan::rebuild`] shares it.
//! This is intentional, not an isolation leak:
//!
//! - Rate-limit and value-cap predicate counters are keyed by
//!   `(hook, tenant, capability)` with **no `run_id`** — they are *definitionally*
//!   tenant-scoped. A run-scoped rate limit would reset to zero at the start of
//!   every run and could never enforce a cross-run budget, which is useless.
//! - So the counter STATE is deliberately tenant-scoped and shared across runs
//!   within one tenant. Two host builds minted from the same runtime share the
//!   same predicate counters — by design.
//! - What *is* per-run-fresh is the **dispatcher** itself: each `rebuild` mints
//!   a fresh [`HookDispatcherBuilder`]/registry so slot-poisoning and registry
//!   mutations never leak across runs.
//!
//! That split — per-run-fresh dispatcher, tenant-scoped predicate counters — is
//! the documented isolation boundary. The
//! `predicate_counter_state_is_tenant_scoped_across_rebuilds` test pins the
//! shared-across-runs half; `rebuild_mints_independent_dispatchers_per_call`
//! pins the fresh-dispatcher half. Both must hold.
//!
//! ## Predicate backend (in-memory for v1)
//!
//! The evaluator uses the in-memory predicate-state backend for now. The
//! backend is swappable ([`PredicateEvaluator::with_state_backend`]) so the
//! durable Postgres/libSQL backends (#3933 + follow-ups) can drop in without
//! touching this module's wiring. See the `warn_in_memory_backend_active_in_
//! production` note emitted at construction time.
