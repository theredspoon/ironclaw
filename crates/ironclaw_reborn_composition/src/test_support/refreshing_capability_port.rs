//! Production capability-port assembly test support (harness-port-seam P1).
//!
//! Lets the Reborn integration-test harness assemble its capability port
//! through the REAL production factory
//! (`create_refreshing_local_dev_capability_port`,
//! `runtime::local_dev::refreshing_capability_port.rs:75`) instead of hand-
//! rebuilding the wrap order, so every current and future production layer
//! (surface disclosure, external tools, StaleSurface refresh, the shared
//! `LocalDevCapabilityIo`) is automatically exercised by the harness too.

/// Typed bundle of the parts the harness controls, passed by value through
/// the `test_support` -> `runtime` -> `runtime::local_dev` forwarding chain
/// so no layer needs `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]`. Mirrors
/// `RefreshingLocalDevCapabilityPortConfig` minus the no-op-by-default parts
/// (`external_tool_catalog`, `policy`). `extension_surface_source` itself
/// stays no-op-by-default too — the harness supplies the raw
/// `extension_management` port below (Change 3, harness-port-seam P1
/// follow-up) and `create_refreshing_local_dev_capability_port_for_test`
/// wraps it in `LocalDevExtensionSurfaceSource::new(..)` internally, the SAME
/// constructor production's `capability_wiring` calls
/// (`runtime/local_dev.rs:132-133`) — this crate is the only place that can
/// name the `pub(in crate::runtime)` wrapper type.
