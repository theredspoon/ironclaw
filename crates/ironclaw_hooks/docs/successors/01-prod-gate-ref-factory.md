# Successor PR: production hook gate-ref factory

> Successor work from PR #3573. Until this lands, hook `PauseApproval` /
> `PauseAuth` decisions surface as `Denied` in production because the
> default factory is `FailClosedHookGateRefFactory`.

## Scope

Implement a `HookGateRefFactory` that mints refs the host's existing
approval/auth router can resolve. The current `UuidHookGateRefFactory`
mints v4 UUIDs — locally unique but router-unregistered, so the loop
parks on a ref the gateway has never heard of. That's why the middleware
default is fail-closed (henrypark133 Critical #3).

## What this factory must do

1. **Reserve a gate.** On `mint_approval_ref(reason)`, register a new
   pending approval with the host's approval gateway. The returned
   `LoopGateRef` is the gateway's chosen identifier — not synthesized
   in the factory.
2. **Bind to `LoopRunContext`.** The factory carries the current
   `LoopRunContext` so the reservation is keyed against the right
   run / thread / tenant. Resolution events route back to the correct
   loop.
3. **Carry one-shot + TTL semantics.** Reservations expire after a
   configurable window (operator policy). The gateway enforces
   one-shot consumption — once a user approval lands, the ref is
   marked consumed and a replay attempt is rejected.
4. **Symmetric `mint_auth_ref`** behavior for auth flows.

## Likely surface

```rust
// in ironclaw_reborn (or a new crate if approval lives elsewhere)
pub struct RouterBackedHookGateRefFactory {
    run_context: LoopRunContext,
    approval_gateway: Arc<dyn ApprovalGateway>,
    auth_gateway: Arc<dyn AuthGateway>,
    reservation_ttl: Duration,
}

#[async_trait]
impl HookGateRefFactory for RouterBackedHookGateRefFactory {
    async fn mint_approval_ref(&self, reason: &str) -> Result<LoopGateRef, AgentLoopHostError> {
        // 1. Call approval_gateway.reserve(...) with run_context + reason + ttl
        // 2. Map gateway result to LoopGateRef
        // 3. Fail closed if gateway is unavailable
    }
    // ...
}
```

Wired into `RebornLoopDriverHostFactory::with_hook_gate_ref_factory(...)`
per-build (so `LoopRunContext` is the current run's).

## Threat model considerations

- **Forgery resistance.** Already pinned at the factory side (122-bit v4
  UUIDs or gateway-issued opaque tokens). The router-backed impl should
  use the gateway's existing reservation-id format if it's
  unguessable, otherwise wrap a v4 UUID inside.
- **Replay resistance.** Comes from gateway's one-shot consumption,
  not from the factory. Test: consume a ref twice → second consumption
  rejected with `gate_already_consumed`.
- **TTL bypass.** Operator policy. Test: mint, wait > TTL, attempt
  resolution → rejected with `gate_expired`.
- **Cross-run consumption.** Resolution of run A's gate ref from run B
  must be rejected. Test: mint under run A, attempt consumption under
  run B's context → rejected.

## Required tests (caller level)

All through `RebornLoopDriverHostFactory` with the production factory
installed:

1. **Happy path**: `PauseApproval` hook → outcome is `ApprovalRequired
   { gate_ref }`; user resolves via gateway; loop receives `Resolved`
   event; loop unblocks.
2. **TTL expiry**: mint, wait past TTL, attempt resolution → gateway
   rejects; loop receives `Expired` event.
3. **One-shot**: consume twice → second attempt rejected.
4. **Cross-run**: gate-ref from run A is unconsumable from run B.
5. **Gateway unavailable**: mint fails → middleware surfaces
   `Denied { reason_kind: hook_gate_ref_unavailable }`.

## What this PR does NOT do

- Change the middleware default (stays `FailClosedHookGateRefFactory`).
- Provide a UI for the operator to configure TTL — that's the host's
  config concern.
- Touch the existing `UuidHookGateRefFactory` (kept for tests + dev).

## Risk

- Cross-crate dependency on the approval/auth gateway. May require a
  trait extraction if the gateway lives downstream of `ironclaw_hooks`.
- Coordination with the channel-to-user path (#3564 area).

## Effort

Medium. Most of the complexity is in the cross-crate seam to the
approval gateway, not in the factory itself.

## Codex review addenda (2026-05-14)

Codex flagged two scope-shaping issues during the design review pass:

### Critical: actor/session binding

The original scope binds reservations to `(run, thread, tenant)` but
not to the *resolving user/session*. In a multi-user / multi-session
deployment that's a same-tenant approval-bypass vector: user B inside
tenant α can resolve a gate-ref issued for user A's pending action.

**Mitigation**: the gateway reservation must carry the actor
identity (or session id) that originated the suspension, and the
gateway's resolution check must compare the resolving actor against
the reservation. The implementation PR will:

- Bind `LoopRunContext.scope.{tenant_id, actor_id, session_id?}`
  (or the channel-equivalent) into the reservation.
- Add a caller-level negative test: ext-A's gate-ref issued in
  user-A's session is rejected when user-B resolves it.

### Recommendation: capability + arguments digest in reservation

The original scope binds `reason` (free-form text). The gateway can
show better context — and reject more replay vectors — if the
reservation includes the *exact* capability id + arguments digest
the hook intended to gate. That way:

- The user-facing approval UI displays "approve calling
  `polymarket.place_order` with args digest XXXX", not a free-form
  string.
- A future call that doesn't match the reserved digest cannot
  consume the gate-ref even if it shares the same capability id.

The implementation PR will include both fields in the reservation
payload alongside `reason`.
