//! Sinks — the trait surfaces hook authors receive when they're invoked.
//!
//! There are two sink surfaces per kind:
//!
//! - `Privileged*` — exposed to `Builtin` and `Trusted` hooks. Carries the
//!   full decision vocabulary including `Allow` for gate sinks and
//!   `add_trusted_snippet` for mutator sinks (no envelope required).
//! - `Restricted*` — exposed to `Installed` hooks. Does *not* expose `Allow`
//!   for gates and only accepts envelope-wrapped snippets for mutators. An
//!   `Installed` hook author literally cannot call `.allow()` — the method
//!   does not exist on this trait — so a malicious or buggy extension cannot
//!   override a more-restrictive prior decision.
//!
//! The framework adds one hook trait per (point, tier) pair so that the
//! signature an author writes against also carries the tier constraint at
//! compile time. The dispatcher routes through a `BoxedHook` enum that holds
//! either the privileged or restricted impl.
