//! Reborn loop hook framework.
//!
//! See `CLAUDE.md` in this crate for the trust model, dependency direction, and
//! non-negotiable invariants. The short version:
//!
//! - Hooks have four trust classes (Builtin, Trusted, Installed, SelfAuthored)
//!   enforced at the type level via the [`sink`] traits.
//! - Decision and patch types in [`kinds`] are sealed: only this crate can mint
//!   them, so an extension cannot forge a trusted policy through `pub` fields.
//! - The framework owns the contract, but Reborn host composition is now wired:
//!   `HookedLoopCapabilityPort`, `HookedLoopPromptPort`, and the other
//!   middleware in [`middleware`] wrap the corresponding Reborn loop ports and
//!   are installed by `ironclaw_reborn`'s loop driver host.
