//! Pluggable backend for predicate sliding-window state.
//!
//! The [`PredicateEvaluator`] in [`crate::evaluator`] delegates its
//! counter / value-sum bookkeeping to a [`PredicateStateBackend`]. The
//! default backend ([`InMemoryPredicateStateBackend`]) preserves the
//! existing in-process semantics; future durable backends
//! (Postgres-backed, libSQL-backed) implement the same trait so the
//! evaluator's predicate logic stays backend-agnostic.
//!
//! # Visibility
//!
//! The backend trait and the in-memory impl are intentionally
//! `pub(crate)` until the durable contract is stable. The trait's `now:
//! Instant` is correct for the in-memory backend but not serializable
//! across processes, so a future durable trait will accept
//! `chrono::DateTime<Utc>` (see successor doc 03-persistent-counter.md).
//! Holding the public surface back until then avoids shipping a public
//! API we know we'll break (serrrfirat MED on PR #3635).
//!
//! [`PredicateEventId`] stays `pub` because it flows through
//! [`BeforeCapabilityHookContext::caller_event_id`] on the public hook
//! surface; only the backend trait and its keys/error type are crate-
//! internal until the durable contract is ready.
//!
//! # Why a trait
//!
//! - **Cross-process consistency**: Hook 1 increments → Hook 2 (different
//!   process, same tenant) reads the updated count.
//! - **Restart survival**: counter state survives process restart.
//! - **Replay refusal**: each record call carries a [`PredicateEventId`].
//!   Re-emitting a recorded `event_id` is a no-op against the count —
//!   the in-memory backend skips, durable backends `INSERT … ON CONFLICT
//!   DO NOTHING`. This is the load-bearing property for replay safety
//!   (codex Critical on PR #3635).
//!
//! # Atomic record-and-read
//!
//! Each [`record_invocation`] / [`record_value`] call performs the
//! write AND returns the resulting in-window count/sum. The two
//! operations must be atomic against concurrent writers (codex
//! Critical on PR #3635) — splitting them into `record` + `read`
//! would let two hosts each see "1 under cap" and both proceed,
//! letting the cap drift past `max`. Implementations must hold a
//! single lock / transaction across the write + read.
//!
//! # Sync trait, monotonic clock
//!
//! The trait is **synchronous** in this PR to minimize call-site churn.
//! [`Instant`] is monotonic (process-local) and is the right clock for
//! the in-memory backend; durable backends will accept a
//! [`std::time::SystemTime`]-based companion via a separate trait or
//! adapter (tracked in the scope doc) since `Instant` cannot be
//! serialized across processes.
