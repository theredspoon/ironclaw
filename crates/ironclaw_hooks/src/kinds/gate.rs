//! Gate decisions for the `before_capability` hook point.

//! and the constructors are `pub(crate)`. The sink traits in
//! [`crate::sink`] are the only public path that mints decisions, and the
//! `InstalledHookSink` impl deliberately does not expose `allow` — an
//! `Installed`-tier hook cannot mint a permissive override.
