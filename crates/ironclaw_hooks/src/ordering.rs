//! Deterministic ordering of hooks at a point.
//!
//! Two-level: **phase** (coarse, restricted by trust class) → **priority**
//! (fine, author-chosen) → **hook id** (stable tiebreak). The phases for
//! gate-class points are:
//!
//! 1. [`HookPhase::Validation`] — input shape, schema, well-formedness.
//!    Builtin only.
//! 2. [`HookPhase::Authorization`] — capability is in user's surface; no
//!    scope violation. Builtin only.
//! 3. [`HookPhase::Policy`] — restrictive policy hooks (e.g., "no shell
//!    exec while on mobile"). Trusted and Installed (with grant).
//! 4. [`HookPhase::Telemetry`] — observers; always run regardless of
//!    short-circuiting in earlier phases so audit consumers can see the
//!    final decision.

///   your audit hook must run after another extension's policy hook at
///   the same Policy phase, declare it: pick `priority = 200` (or
///   higher) so the order is intentional, not accidental.

///
/// - Modeling a phase relationship (e.g., "this hook authorizes, that
