//! Durable libSQL-backed [`PredicateStateBackend`] implementation.
//!
//! Mirrors the in-memory backend's invariants
//! (`ironclaw_hooks::predicate_state::InMemoryPredicateStateBackend`) against a
//! libSQL / SQLite database so predicate counter / value-sum state survives
//! process restart and is consistent across every host pointing at the same
//! database file. The schema lives in [`crate::schema`]; scope/key-hash
//! derivation in [`crate::hashing`].
//!
//! [`PredicateStateBackend`]: ironclaw_hooks::predicate_state::PredicateStateBackend
//!
//! # Clock basis (aligns with PR 2/4)
//!
//! The stored `occurred_at` is the **host-supplied `now: DateTime<Utc>`**
//! parameter (production passes [`chrono::Utc::now()`]), stored as epoch
//! milliseconds. We do NOT use SQLite `datetime('now')` for the row
//! timestamp: the [`PredicateStateBackend`] trait threads `now` in explicitly
//! so the contract harness can drive a deterministic clock, and window
//! trimming must be relative to that same clock to stay consistent with the
//! in-memory backend. Both durable backends store the host clock verbatim, so
//! they are byte-for-byte semantically identical. Epoch milliseconds (INTEGER)
//! is chosen over an ISO-8601 TEXT column so window arithmetic and ordering
//! are exact integer comparisons with sub-second resolution.
//!
//! # Atomicity
//!
//! Every `record_*` call runs inside a single `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` … `COMMIT`
//! transaction: `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` takes SQLite's write lock up front so
//! concurrent writers serialise (no read-modify-write race window — codex
//! Critical on PR #3635). The trim, dedup-insert, cap check, and the final
//! in-window count/sum read all happen under that one lock, so the write and
//! the returned value are atomic. libSQL's single-writer semantics mean "two
//! hosts" reduces to "two connections contending for the write lock";
//! `PRAGMA busy_timeout` lets the loser wait rather than fail.
//!
//! # Per-key cap: FAIL CLOSED (PR #3635 followup / #3929)
//!
//! When a key already holds [`MAX_SAMPLES_PER_KEY`] in-window rows and a
//! NEW distinct `event_id` arrives, the call returns
//! [`PredicateBackendError::WindowOverflow`] rather than silently dropping the
//! oldest sample. Silent drop-oldest weakened cap enforcement (the count could
//! never exceed the cap, so an `InvocationCount { max >= cap }` predicate would
//! never fire) and broke replay refusal (the evicted id left the dedup set
//! while still logically in-window). A replay of an already-recorded id at the
//! cap dedups to a no-op BEFORE the overflow check, so replay refusal survives
//! the cap boundary. This matches the in-memory backend exactly.
//!
//! [`MAX_SAMPLES_PER_KEY`]: ironclaw_hooks::predicate_state::MAX_SAMPLES_PER_KEY
//! [`PredicateBackendError::WindowOverflow`]: ironclaw_hooks::predicate_state::PredicateBackendError::WindowOverflow
//!
//! # Running-sum consistency under eviction
//!
//! The value backend does not keep an external running sum; the in-window sum
//! is computed by summing the surviving rows inside the same transaction after
//! trimming, so it is always exactly the sum of the rows that survive —
//! consistency under eviction is structural.

/// mechanisms, layered:
///
/// 1. **In-process write serialisation (`write_lock`).** Every mutating op
///    (`record_invocation`, `record_value`, `evict_older_than`,
///    `run_migrations`) acquires a per-backend `Arc<Mutex<()>>` and holds it
///    for the whole `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` … `COMMIT` transaction. This is the
///    primary admission control: it serialises all writers from THIS process
///    before they ever contend at the SQLite layer. Without it, an unbounded
///    fan-out (e.g. a heartbeat tick evaluating thousands of hooks at once)
///    races on the single SQLite write lock; in libSQL's replication-enabled
///    build a raw `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` statement can return `SQLITE_BUSY`
///    *immediately* instead of honouring `busy_timeout`, surfacing as
///    `Unavailable("database is locked")` — which **fail-closes** predicate
///    evaluation (a hook that should pass gets denied under load). Serialising
///    in-process keeps each process to one writer at a time, so the file-handle
///    footprint stays flat and the SQLite write lock is never contended from
///    within the process. This is exactly the `write_lock: Arc<Mutex<()>>`
///    pattern `LibSqlWorkspaceStore` uses for the same reason.
///
/// 2. **Cross-process serialisation (`PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000`).** Two
///    separate processes (or two backend instances over different `Database`
///    handles) still reduce to two connections contending for the single
///    SQLite write lock; the busy timeout makes the loser wait up to 5 s
///    rather than fail. The in-process mutex does not span instances, so this
///    remains the cross-instance backstop.
///
/// 3. **Connect retry.** Connection creation retries with exponential backoff
///    on transient open failures (`SQLITE_CANTOPEN` during concurrent opens),
///    matching `LibSqlBackend::connect`.
///
/// None of this changes the transactional contract: each op still runs inside
/// one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` … `COMMIT`, and a genuinely unavailable backend still
/// surfaces as [`PredicateBackendError::Unavailable`] /
/// [`PredicateBackendError::WindowOverflow`], which fail-close predicate
/// evaluation. The point is to keep *transient* load from being mistaken for a
