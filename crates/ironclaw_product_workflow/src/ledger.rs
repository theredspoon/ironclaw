/// Host runtimes provide a durable implementation backed by the DB layer.
/// Tests use the in-memory fake from the `test-support` feature.
///
/// # Non-terminal action recovery contract
///
/// `begin_or_replay` reserves a fingerprint by recording a `Received` action
/// before workflow dispatch starts. A durable implementation must not leave that
/// reservation permanent if the process crashes or a transient dispatch failure
/// prevents `settle` from recording a terminal outcome. Implementations must use
/// a recovery lease/TTL (or an equivalent background sweeper) for non-terminal
/// `Received`/`Dispatched` actions:
///
/// - settled actions replay forever;
/// - fresh non-terminal actions return a transient error so callers retry later
///   instead of dispatching the same side effect concurrently;
/// - expired non-terminal actions are reclaimed by the sweeper or by
///   `begin_or_replay` before returning `New` for the fingerprint again.
///
/// The test-support fake models fresh in-flight reservations and exposes
/// `expire_in_flight_before` to simulate the sweeper path in downstream tests.
