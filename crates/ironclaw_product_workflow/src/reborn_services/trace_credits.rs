//! Contributor-local Trace Commons credit projection for WebChat v2.

//! The WebUI surface is read-only: it reports the caller-scoped local
//! view of Trace Commons credit as of the last credit sync. The
//! authoritative ledger lives server-side; nothing here mutates trace

//! always derived from the authenticated caller's tenant + user id (see
//! [`ironclaw_reborn_traces::contribution::trace_scope_key`]).
