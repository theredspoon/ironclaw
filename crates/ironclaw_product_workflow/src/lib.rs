//! Product-facing workflow facade for IronClaw Reborn.
//!
//! `ironclaw_product_workflow` sits between product adapters and host-layer
//! Reborn services. It owns the product action orchestration so that adapters
//! (Web, API, CLI, Telegram, etc.) do not each reimplement binding resolution,
//! message staging, idempotency, busy/deferred handling, gate routing, mission
//! routing, and redacted acknowledgements.
//!
//! ## Key types
//!
//! - [`DefaultProductWorkflow`] — top-level orchestrator that implements
//!   [`ironclaw_product_adapters::ProductWorkflow`].
//! - [`InboundTurnService`] / [`DefaultInboundTurnService`] — the narrower
//!   user-message path that coordinates binding + turn submission.
//! - [`ConversationBindingService`] — resolves external adapter refs to
//!   canonical Reborn identifiers.
//! - [`IdempotencyLedger`] — durable action deduplication port.
//! - [`ProductInboundAction`] — durable ledger record for inbound actions.
