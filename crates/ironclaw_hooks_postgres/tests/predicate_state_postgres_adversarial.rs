//! Adversarial / multi-host tests for [`PostgresPredicateStateBackend`].
//!
//! These prove the durable backend's cross-host correctness properties
//! that the in-memory backend explicitly does NOT provide (its dedup is
//! process-local). Each "host" is a separate `deadpool` pool over the
//! same database, simulating distinct processes pointing at one Postgres.
//!
//! Gated on a reachable Postgres via `IRONCLAW_HOOKS_POSTGRES_URL` /
//! `DATABASE_URL`; skipped (passing) otherwise — same env-gate pattern as
//! the contract suite. Serialized behind a process-global lock because
//! they share fixed keys against one table.
