//! [`PostgresPredicateStateBackend`] — durable, cross-host-consistent
//! implementation of [`PredicateStateBackend`].
//!
//! # Atomic record-and-read (the load-bearing property)
//!
//! Every `record_*` call runs inside a single `READ COMMITTED`
//! transaction guarded by a transaction-scoped advisory lock on the
//! bucket (and, for new-key eviction, a second advisory lock on the
//! scope). The advisory lock — not a high isolation level — is what
//! serializes concurrent writers to the same bucket: it makes the second
//! writer *block* until the first commits rather than aborting it with a
//! serialization failure (which would force a caller retry loop). The
//! transaction body:
//!
//! 1. **Trims** rows for the key with `occurred_at < cutoff` (out of
//!    window). This also frees the dedup `event_id` of any trimmed row, so
//!    an `event_id` that aged out of the window can be re-recorded —
//!    matching the in-memory backend, whose dedup memory is exactly the
//!    in-window entry set.
//! 2. **Dedup-checks** the incoming `event_id` against the in-window rows
//!    for the key. A match is a replay — a no-op that short-circuits before
//!    the cap check and returns the unchanged aggregate. This is the
//!    cross-host replay defense (a row written by host A blocks host B's
//!    re-insert of the same id regardless of clock skew) AND the property
//!    that lets a replay survive the cap boundary.
//! 3. **Caps fail-closed**: if the `event_id` is new (not a replay) and the
//!    in-window count is already at [`MAX_SAMPLES_PER_KEY`], the call
//!    returns [`PredicateBackendError::WindowOverflow`] WITHOUT inserting —
//!    matching the in-memory backend's `if !dedup && len >= cap { Err }`
//!    contract exactly. Silently evicting the oldest sample would weaken
//!    cap enforcement and break replay refusal (the evicted id would leave
//!    the dedup set while still logically in-window), so we fail closed.
//! 4. **Inserts** the new row `ON CONFLICT (key_hash, event_id) DO NOTHING`
//!    into the kind-specific table (`hooks_predicate_invocations` for
//!    counts, `hooks_predicate_values` for numeric sums — explicit typed
//!    tables, not a generic `kind` discriminator column).
//! 5. **Evicts** the scope's oldest-front key — the key whose oldest
//!    retained sample (`MIN(occurred_at)`) is oldest — when the scope's
//!    distinct-key count exceeds [`MAX_KEYS_PER_TENANT`] (the durable
//!    analogue of the in-memory per-tenant LRU quota, which ranks buckets by
//!    their oldest entry). Each victim's rows
//!    are deleted only after acquiring that victim key's per-key advisory
//!    lock with the NON-blocking `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock`, so eviction
//!    obeys the same per-bucket serialization as a recorder and can never
//!    deadlock against (or tear the aggregate of) a concurrent write to the
//!    victim bucket. Eviction is an explicit quota OUTCOME: it requeries and
//!    keeps evicting until the per-scope cap is met, or FAILS CLOSED
//!    ([`PredicateBackendError::Unavailable`]) rather than committing an
//!    over-quota scope — it is never silently best-effort (see
//!    [`PostgresPredicateStateBackend::enforce_scope_quota`]).
//! 6. **Aggregates** the in-window `COUNT(*)` (invocation table) / `SUM(value)`
//!    (value table) and returns it.
//!
//! Steps 1-6 share one transaction under the bucket advisory lock, so two
//! concurrent writers can never both observe "1 under cap" and both
//! proceed — the second blocks until the first commits. This is the codex
//! Critical atomicity requirement from PR #3635.
//!
//! # Cap semantics — fail-closed, NOT drop-oldest
//!
//! When a key's in-window sample count reaches [`MAX_SAMPLES_PER_KEY`] and
//! a NEW distinct id arrives, the backend returns
//! [`PredicateBackendError::WindowOverflow`] rather than evicting the
//! oldest sample to make room. This matches the in-memory backend and the
//! trait contract (PR #3635 followup / #3929): the evaluator maps the error
//! to a restrictive DENY/PauseApproval, so overflow surfaces as a refusal,
//! never a silent Allow. Replay of an already-recorded in-window id still
//! short-circuits to a no-op before the cap check (step 2), so replay
//! refusal survives the cap boundary.
