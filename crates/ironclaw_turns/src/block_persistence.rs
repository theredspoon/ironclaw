//! Durable persistence for blocked turns under the in-memory turn-state
//! authority.
//!
//! The in-memory authority (`InMemoryTurnStateStore`) removes the per-user
//! `state.json` CAS livelock by coordinating turns in one process, but it is
//! otherwise volatile: a process restart drops all runs. That is acceptable for
//! in-flight compute (short-lived, re-triggerable), but **not** for a turn
//! parked on a human gate (approval/auth) — a deploy would silently drop it and
//! the user's "Approve" would land on nothing.
//!
//! `TurnStateBlockPersistence` closes exactly that gap **off the hot path**: the
//! store persists the (small, low-frequency) snapshot only when the set of
//! gate-blocked runs changes — a run blocks on a gate, or such a run resumes /
//! terminates. Normal turn traffic (claim → complete) never touches the sink, so
//! it does not reintroduce the contention the in-memory authority removed.
