//! In-memory-backed budget-gate store constructor for tests.
//!
//! The Reborn architecture-simplification note
//! (`docs/reborn/2026-07-17-architecture-simplification-dto-dyn-local.md`, §4.3)
//! replaces hand-written `InMemory*Store` parallel implementations with the one
//! production `Filesystem*Store<F>` exercised over an in-memory backend:
//! "in-memory" stops being a store and becomes a filesystem backend
//! (`InMemoryBackend`). This helper wires that seam for the budget-gate store —
//! a `ScopedFilesystem<InMemoryBackend>` mounting `/resources` (the alias the
//! store persists its `/resources/budget-gates.json` snapshot under) — so tests
//! instantiate the same store a deployment runs.
//!
//! Note on isolation: [`FilesystemBudgetGateStore`] serializes a single snapshot
//! file per `/resources` mount, keyed internally by `BudgetGateId`; it carries no
//! scope in the path, so tenant/user isolation lives entirely in the
//! `MountView`. The single fixed mount below therefore behaves exactly like the
//! deleted `InMemoryBudgetGateStore` did — one shared snapshot regardless of the
//! per-op `ResourceScope` — which is what the single-scope gate-lifecycle tests
//! (open/get/resolve/list/expire under one scope) need. Cross-tenant isolation is
//! exercised by the per-tenant-mount tests in `filesystem_store.rs`.
//!
//! Terminal retention is disabled ([`with_terminal_retention(None)`]) so tests
//! can inspect resolved/expired gates without a time window — matching the
//! retain-forever semantics of the deleted in-memory store. Production
//! composition keeps the default bounded retention via plain
//! [`FilesystemBudgetGateStore::new`].
//!
//! Gated behind `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "test-support"))]` and disabled by
//! default. Downstream crates should enable `test-support` only from their
//! `[dev-dependencies]`.
