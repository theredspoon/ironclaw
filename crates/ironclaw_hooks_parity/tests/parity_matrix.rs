//! Cross-backend parity matrix — the load-bearing test of durable-backend
//! PR 4/4.
//!
//! A single deterministic, scripted sequence of `record_invocation` /
//! `record_value` calls (fixed ids, timestamps, values) is fed to **every**
//! `PredicateStateBackend` implementation, and the per-step observable output
//! (returned count / sum, error variant, the running `evictions_observed()`
//! counter) is captured into an [`ObservationLog`]. The matrix then cross-
//! asserts that every backend produced the *identical* log. That equality is
//! the proof the three backends are behaviorally interchangeable: the
//! evaluator can swap in-memory ⇄ Postgres ⇄ libSQL without changing a single
//! gate decision.
//!
//! # Which legs run
//!
//! - **in-memory**: always (pure process state).
//! - **libSQL**: always — the backend runs over an embedded temp-file db that
//!   needs no server, so this leg executes in any environment, including
//!   default `cargo test`.
//! - **Postgres**: compiled only under `--features postgres`, and at runtime
//!   only when `IRONCLAW_HOOKS_POSTGRES_URL` / `DATABASE_URL` points at a
//!   reachable server. Without a URL the Postgres leg is *skipped* (not
//!   failed), exactly like the per-backend contract suites — but then the
//!   parity guarantee is only proven for {in-memory, libSQL}. Set
//!   `IRONCLAW_REQUIRE_POSTGRES=1` (CI does) to turn a missing/unreachable
//!   Postgres into a HARD failure so a skip cannot masquerade as a green
//!   full-matrix run. A real-Postgres CI run is required before merge to fully
//!   exercise the matrix (same caveat as #3933).
//!
//! # Why a captured log cross-checked against an independent oracle
//!
//! Capturing the full per-step output of one backend and asserting the others
//! reproduce it exactly means a NEW behavioral divergence (a backend that
//! fails closed at a different boundary, dedups differently, or returns a
//! different sum) surfaces as a concrete `assert_eq!` diff naming the diverging
//! step — instead of silently passing because each backend's own bespoke
//! assertions happened to be loose.
//!
//! Cross-backend equality alone is necessary but not sufficient: if two
//! backends shared the SAME semantic bug they would agree with each other and
//! still pass. So each script ALSO carries an independent, hand-computed
//! `expected_*` oracle log (the count/sum/error sequence worked out from the
//! semantics, not captured from any backend), and every backend — including the
//! in-memory reference — is asserted against that oracle. A shared bug now
//! fails because both backends diverge from the oracle. If this file ever
//! fails, it has found a real bug in a backend (or a stale oracle — fix the
//! bug, do NOT silently update the oracle to match a regressed backend); do NOT
//! loosen the assertion to make it pass.

// SQLITE_MISUSE serialization caveat (f-tests-3 on #3937): the tests in this
// file run concurrently under the default libtest harness, and each libSQL leg
// builds a fresh in-process `Database` handle. Cap-heavy scripts that push
// thousands of rows through such a handle while sibling tests do the same can
// intermittently trip `SQLITE_MISUSE` ("bad parameter or other API misuse").
// The process-global serialization mutex lives in `support.rs` (see
// `libsql_serial_guard` and the comment above its lock site); any FUTURE cap-fill
// or otherwise statement-heavy parity script MUST route its libSQL leg through
// that guard rather than constructing an unguarded handle.
//
// `#[path]` keeps these submodules in the `parity_matrix/` subdirectory: files
// directly under `tests/` are each compiled as their own integration-test
// binary, but files in a subdirectory are not — so the shared support/scenario/
// oracle code lives in `tests/parity_matrix/` and is pulled in here explicitly.
