# IronClaw Crates Map

Instructions for AI coding assistants entering `crates/`, which contains Reborn crates plus legacy v1 support crates.

This file is a routing map, not a full architecture spec. Pick the crate(s) that match the change, then read crate-local guidance before editing:

1. `crates/<crate>/AGENTS.md` when present.
2. `crates/<crate>/CLAUDE.md` if present.
3. `crates/<crate>/CONTRACT.md` or `README.md` if present.
4. Matching `docs/reborn/contracts/*.md` when behavior crosses crate boundaries.

Do **not** eagerly load every crate guide. Use this map to choose.

## Branch and Workspace

This map was last refreshed 2026-07-02 against the workspace crate manifests, source layout, tests, and crate-local docs. Most crates have a crate-local `AGENTS.md`; when one is missing, load `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRACT.md` or `README.md` if present, `Cargo.toml`, and the crate's primary `src/` entrypoint instead.

Run crate work from repo root unless crate-local docs say otherwise.

```bash
cargo test -p <crate_name>
cargo clippy -p <crate_name> --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture
scripts/check-boundaries.sh
scripts/reborn-e2e-rust.sh
```

Use targeted crate tests first. Add `ironclaw_architecture` when dependency edges or layer ownership change. Run Reborn e2e when turns, runtime lanes, host services, authorization, approvals, networking, secrets, product workflow, or capability dispatch change. Note: `scripts/check-boundaries.sh` inspects the v1 `src/` tree only — for `crates/`, boundary enforcement is `cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture`.

## Guidance Files

- `AGENTS.md` — crate-local agent entrypoint; read first.
- `CLAUDE.md` — crate guardrails/spec; read before changing behavior.
- `CONTRACT.md` — public cross-crate contract; update with semantic changes.
- `README.md` — helper/user/operator details.
- `docs/reborn/contracts/*.md` — Reborn source-of-truth contracts.
- `crates/ironclaw_architecture` — mechanical dependency-boundary enforcement.

Treat crate-local `AGENTS.md` as the first file to load when it exists. Several crates lack one — don't rely on a hand-maintained list; find them with `for d in crates/ironclaw_*/; do [ -f "$d/AGENTS.md" ] || echo "$d"; done` and fall back to `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRACT.md` or `README.md` if present, `Cargo.toml`, and the crate's primary `src/` entrypoint (`src/lib.rs` for libraries, `src/main.rs` for binaries).

## Dependency Mental Model

Keep lower layers neutral. Product and runtime composition flows downward through typed contracts, not concrete shortcuts.

```text
common / host_api / prompt_envelope
  -> filesystem / memory / events / event_projections / event_streams / extensions / trust / resources
  -> secrets / network / outbound / channel_host / channel_delivery / run_state / authorization / approvals / runtime_policy / hooks
  -> host_runtime / processes / dispatcher / runtime lanes (scripts, mcp, wasm, wasm_limiter)
  -> turns / threads / agent_loop / loop_host / capabilities
  -> reborn composition / product adapters / product workflow / product workflow storage / CLI
  -> engine / llm / gateway / webui_v2 / webui_ingress / tui / root product integration
```

Boundary rule: if you need an upstream crate in a low-level crate, stop and check `crates/ironclaw_architecture` plus matching Reborn contract.

| `ironclaw_projects` | `ironclaw_projects/CLAUDE.md` | Project entity + membership ACL (live `resolve_access`, never cached) + `ProjectRepository` over `RootFilesystem` with CAS create/delete. **W2 decision: keep standalone; do not fold into composition.** | The legacy engine `Project` type; product workflow facade logic.

| `ironclaw_hooks_parity` | `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs` | Test-only cross-backend adversarial parity suite proving in-memory/Postgres/libSQL backends behaviorally interchangeable (its `src/` is doc-only by design). | Production code or deps. |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ironclaw_runner` | `ironclaw_runner/AGENTS.md`, `ironclaw_runner/CLAUDE.md` | **Internal runner control plane and loop-runtime assembly** (sole production consumer: `ironclaw_reborn_composition`; test harnesses may use it directly): scheduler, per-run executor, driver registry, planned/text driver adapters, loop host factory, exit-applier wiring, home/profile/doctor support. | Treating it as a public composition root; V1 root runtime imports unless explicitly bridged. |
| `ironclaw_reborn_config` | `ironclaw_reborn_config/AGENTS.md`, `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs` | Boot configuration contracts for standalone Reborn binary. | Runtime execution or product adapter behavior. |

| `ironclaw_webui` | `ironclaw_webui/AGENTS.md`, `ironclaw_webui/CLAUDE.md`, `ironclaw_webui/README.md` | The whole WebUI host stack for Reborn WebChat v2: the `webui_v2` route surface + axum handlers + descriptor table + redacted `WebUiV2HttpError` (folded up from the former `ironclaw_webui_v2`), the Vite SPA bundle (`frontend/`), the `webui_v2_app` gateway assembly + middleware stack, the listener/serve loop, and host authentication (Env/Session/OIDC authenticators, `SessionStore`, `/auth/*` OAuth login). | Product/API business logic (consume `RebornServicesApi` only), a direct `ironclaw_product_adapters` edge, transcript storage, v1 channel code. |
| `ironclaw_slack_v2_adapter` | `ironclaw_slack_v2_adapter/AGENTS.md` | Slack v2 ProductAdapter: protocol parsing/rendering only (payloads, mrkdwn, delivery DTOs).

| `ironclaw_product_context` | `ironclaw_product_context/AGENTS.md` | Single owner of turn-origin/surface trust classification at ingress; only its `TrustedTrigger` arm mints `ScheduledTrigger`. Deliberately tiny and dependency-light (host_api + turns only). | Adding anything — its value is staying small enough for every ingress layer to call without cycles. |
| `ironclaw_reborn_identity` | `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs` | Canonical identity mapping: every external identity (OAuth login, channel actor) → stable `UserId` before runtime state; filesystem-backed resolver fronted through composition. | Auth flows, session storage, provider HTTP. |

WebChat v2 assets live in `ironclaw_webui_v2_static`. | Browser API/web channel runtime (`src/channels/web/`) or product workflow; Reborn WebChat v2 work. |
| `ironclaw_tui` | `ironclaw_tui/AGENTS.md`, `ironclaw_tui/CLAUDE.md` | **v1-only today** (sole consumer: the root crate). Ratatui app, widgets, layout, render, theme, event/input loop, spinner. | Main crate channel bridge (`src/channels/tui.rs`) or backend workflow; new Reborn surfaces. |
| `ironclaw_silk_decoder` | `ironclaw_silk_decoder/AGENTS.md`, `ironclaw_silk_decoder/README.md`, `ironclaw_silk_decoder/Cargo.toml`, `ironclaw_silk_decoder/src/main.rs` | Excluded helper binary that decodes WeChat SILK v3 voice notes to WAV. | Main workspace build dependencies; keep libclang isolated. |
| `ironclaw_webui_v2_static` | `frontend/README.md`, `src/lib.rs` | WebChat v2 static SPA bundle: a thin Rust embedding harness (`static_router`) over the `static/` JS app; zero workspace deps by design. | Route semantics / listener / auth — all now in `ironclaw_webui`. |
| `ironclaw_embeddings` | `ironclaw_embeddings/AGENTS.md` | `EmbeddingProvider` trait + OpenAI/NearAI/Ollama/Bedrock impls + caching decorator. **v1-only today** (sole consumer: the root crate; not yet wired Reborn-side). | Reborn runtime wiring assumptions; memory-native's same-named local port (deliberately separate). |

## Common Change Routes

- Host API shape: `ironclaw_host_api` -> matching `docs/reborn/contracts/*.md` -> affected service/runtime crates -> `ironclaw_architecture`.
- Storage and persistence: owning domain crate for schemas/queries; preserve libSQL/PostgreSQL parity where applicable. Product workflow ledger adapters live behind `ironclaw_product_workflow`'s `storage`/`libsql`/`postgres` features; event/audit store backends live in `ironclaw_reborn_event_store`.
- Files/memory: `ironclaw_filesystem` for mount/path authority; `ironclaw_memory` for memory documents/search/chunking/indexing.
- Events/projections/outbound: `ironclaw_events` for canonical redacted events; `ironclaw_event_projections` for projection model; `ironclaw_event_streams` for transport-neutral live/replay streams; `ironclaw_outbound` for metadata-only delivery/subscription policy; adapters for concrete delivery.
- Trust/auth/approval: `ironclaw_trust` -> `ironclaw_authorization` -> `ironclaw_run_state`/`ironclaw_approvals` -> `ironclaw_capabilities` as needed.
- Hooks and prompt context: `ironclaw_hooks` for hook registration/dispatch/failure policy; `ironclaw_prompt_envelope` for model-visible untrusted or trust-labeled snippet wrapping.
- Reborn runtime execution: lane crate (`scripts`, `mcp`, `wasm`) first; `dispatcher` for routing; `host_runtime` for secrets/network/resources/redaction; `processes` for background lifecycle; `ironclaw_wasm_limiter` only for shared limiter mechanics. Use `ironclaw_engine` only for existing v1 engine maintenance.
- Reborn turns/agent loop: `ironclaw_turns` for turn coordination; `ironclaw_agent_loop` for strategy/planner/executor contracts; `ironclaw_loop_host` for host support ports. Use `ironclaw_engine` only for existing v1 CodeAct/thread runtime maintenance.
- Product adapter flow: `ironclaw_product_adapters` contracts -> `ironclaw_product_adapter_registry` installation/projection -> `ironclaw_product_workflow` orchestration -> concrete adapter crate.
- Reborn binary/composition: `ironclaw_reborn_config` for boot config; `ironclaw_reborn_composition` for production wiring; `ironclaw_reborn_cli` for commands; `ironclaw_runner` for standalone adapters/driver registry; `ironclaw_webui` for host-owned WebChat v2 listener lifecycle.
- Model/provider behavior: `ironclaw_llm`; do not leak provider auth/cache/retry concerns into engine or product workflow.
- UI presentation: `ironclaw_webui` (route surface + serve + auth) and `ironclaw_webui_v2_static` for Reborn WebChat v2; `ironclaw_tui` and `ironclaw_gateway` only for existing v1 UI maintenance. Backend API/web channel code remains under root `src/` unless the surface is the Reborn WebChat v2 host crate.

## Testing

Prefer narrow tests during iteration:

```bash
cargo test -p ironclaw_host_api
cargo test -p ironclaw_network network_policy_contract
cargo test -p ironclaw_outbound --all-features
cargo test -p ironclaw_product_workflow
cargo test -p ironclaw_wasm --test wit_tool_runtime_contract
```

Then expand by risk:

```bash
cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture
scripts/check-boundaries.sh
scripts/reborn-e2e-rust.sh
cargo test --workspace --all-features
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

Persistence behavior must support PostgreSQL and libSQL where applicable. If local Postgres is unavailable, follow crate-local skip flags only when docs/tests explicitly permit them.

## Guardrails

- Avoid `.unwrap()` / `.expect()` in production; use typed errors with context.
- Preserve tenant/user/agent/project/mission/thread scope on authority, state, memory, process, network, outbound, resource, and event records.
- Fail closed for auth, approvals, trust, filesystem containment, network policy, secret leases, runtime selection, and adapter identity.
- Do not expose raw secrets, backend paths, private URLs, transport internals, raw SQL/backend errors, or unredacted runtime/user content across public surfaces.
- Keep runtime crates untrusted: host-runtime mediates secrets/network/redaction/accounting.
- Keep declarative crates declarative: manifests, contracts, registries, and policy descriptions should not perform execution side effects.
- Use existing traits/ports/registries; avoid hardcoded cross-crate shortcuts.
- Test through caller when a helper gates dispatch, persistence, network, secrets, approvals, resources, events, process, adapter, or UI side effects.

## Docs / Parity Checklist

Behavior changes may require updates to:

- crate-local `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRACT.md`, or `README.md`
- `docs/reborn/contracts/*.md`
- `FEATURE_PARITY.md`
- crate changelogs for packages that publish independently
- architecture boundary tests in `crates/ironclaw_architecture`
