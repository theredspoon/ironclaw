# ICWM G0C candidate-neutral harness

This standalone Rust crate packages candidate-neutral contracts, schemas, and
deterministic control fixtures produced by the ICWM Gate 0C architecture
investigation. It is deliberately excluded from the IronClaw workspace and has
no dependency on IronClaw or a Matrix SDK.

Governing Lighthouse G0C status: **Revisions Required**. This is
contribution-grade research infrastructure, and this tracked publication
package is **pending exact-head review**. Investigation review history does not
approve these tracked bytes. The package does not accept Gate 0, G0C, ADR-005,
ADR-006, a production dependency, store, or runtime placement.

## Boundaries

- Inputs are credential-free. Authentication and network mediation remain host
  responsibilities.
- Stable identifiers use domain-separated, length-delimited typed bytes.
- The runner owns effect ordering, virtual time, response scripts, failpoints,
  cancellation, and normalized result production.
- `not_applicable` requires a topology or exact-feature reason; it cannot hide
  an unimplemented applicable test.
- Candidate adapters must expose prepare, commit, and acknowledge boundaries.
  The neutral harness does not claim candidate-store atomicity.
- The control adapter exercises only bounded common contracts; it does not
  prove candidate-store atomicity, crash recovery, or live interoperability.

At the harness layer, `ledger_unknown_*` is label-distinct but currently
state-equivalent to the matching `ledger_after_*` boundary: the normalized
effect has already been appended before either crash is recorded. Only a real
candidate/store adapter can supply the durable-state observation that makes
the unknown boundary semantically different. This is a contribution-grade gap,
not production proof of an ambiguity protocol.

The current deterministic suite does not execute the
`ledger_unknown_crypto_store_append`, any ingress-ledger boundary,
`candidate_after_prepare`, `process_before_effect_append`, or either prepared-
ciphertext-handoff failpoint. It also does not execute `ingress_disposition` or
`prepared_ciphertext` effect kinds. The published control result is narrower
still: it contains one `matrix_request` effect and reaches no failpoint. These
omissions remain required candidate/live-tier work and cannot be inferred from
the existence of enum variants or schemas.

`StatefulResponder` is a bounded deterministic double, not a general Matrix
homeserver. It supports only `sync`, `keys_query`, `keys_claim`, `to_device`,
`cross_signing`, and `signatures_upload` request purposes. Its stored replies
and request capture exercise those selected control paths; unsupported
purposes fail explicitly, and no support for the remaining capability
vocabulary is implied.

Identifier differential tests use only the exact crates.io `ruma-common
0.19.0` identifier parse layer. They do not invoke Ruma strict or historical
validation modes and make no claim about those validators. This is the current
release observed during the 2026-08-11
recapture and the same `ruma-common` version resolved through the Matrix SDK
0.18 candidate graph. It is a test-only oracle, not a production dependency or
an architectural selection of the full SDK. The corpus records oracle parsing,
the independent bounded harness identifier policy, and message admission as
separate outcomes. Admission is a stricter topology/actor policy applied after
identifier parsing; its rejection does not mean the parser rejected the
identifier. Intentional differential cases run in both oracle/harness
directions.
`direct_chat` is a caller-supplied trigger label. For that label, this harness
checks only that the subject has room-ID topology and the actor has user-ID
topology. It does not ingest `m.direct` account data, check room membership in
that mapping, or prove that the event came from a Matrix direct-message room;
those are upstream state/authentication responsibilities.

## Reproduce

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo fmt --manifest-path harness/icwm-g0c/Cargo.toml -- --check
target_dir="$(mktemp -d)"
CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$target_dir" cargo test --locked --manifest-path harness/icwm-g0c/Cargo.toml
CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$target_dir" cargo clippy --locked --manifest-path harness/icwm-g0c/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
python3 harness/icwm-g0c/verify-publication.py
python3 harness/icwm-g0c/test_verify_publication.py
```

Remove the temporary target directory after recording author or verifier
results. A verifier must run these commands independently from a clean
worktree; author runs are not verification.

## Provenance

The tested IronClaw source baseline is
`2d64363101ef0ff062a6345a5573ee855766552f`. The approved ignored-worktree
common aggregate was
`e603556c99acd3de3c69b60acb74486a858993e5bb7fe9d1bd66827ea6d3d34b`.
The tracked
[candidate evidence provenance index](../../docs/internal/research/icwm-g0c/evidence-provenance.json)
binds candidate conclusions to exact source and dependency identities,
normalized retained-receipt hashes, and bounded recapture commands. It does
not publish raw transcripts, graphs, build products, crypto stores, secrets,
ciphertext, live state, or service logs. Authorized recapture uses an
access-controlled disposable worktree and compares new hashes without
overwriting historical receipts. In an authorized retained-evidence checkout,
the gitignored material is placed at the repository-relative
`.work/evidence/icwm-n-g0c/candidates/` convention. It is absent from an
ordinary clone; the index provides per-file and candidate-source-tree digests
that must be confirmed after approved private transfer and before recapture.

Tracked-path publication changes paths and explanatory material, so
`PUBLICATION-MANIFEST.json` is the authoritative file manifest for this
research-and-harness payload surface. Its detached digest is in
`PUBLICATION-MANIFEST.sha256`. Repository CI workflow and shared workflow-
contract scripts are deliberately outside that payload manifest: they are
operational enforcement reviewed and versioned with the containing repository,
not candidate evidence or portable harness input. The manifest must not be
described as authoritative for those CI files.

The verifier defines that portable payload as every regular, non-symlink file
under `harness/icwm-g0c` and `docs/internal/research/icwm-g0c`. Only the
manifest and detached digest themselves plus local `target`, `__pycache__`, and
`.pytest_cache` generated directories are excluded. It rejects both unlisted
payload files and manifest entries outside those roots. Raw retained evidence
is outside these roots under the separately access-controlled `.work` tree; it
is not silently excluded from an otherwise authoritative payload directory.
Generated-directory exclusions apply only when an actual directory entry has
one of those exact basenames. A regular file named `target`, `__pycache__`, or
`.pytest_cache`, or a file merely nested below some differently named path,
remains payload and must be listed. This distinction makes the completeness
check resistant to hiding an added payload file behind a reserved-looking
filename; symlinked files and directories fail closed rather than being
treated as generated output.

In result fixtures, the legacy field name `harness_commit` means the tested
IronClaw source baseline, not the commit that contains this standalone harness.
It must equal `component_commits.ironclaw_source_baseline` and the publication
manifest's `tested_source_baseline`; the containing harness commit remains
externally bound by exact-head review to avoid a circular self-hash.

`scenario_id` is derived with the harness `StableId` algorithm under the
`scenario` domain from five ordered components: schema version, name, and
canonical JSON for inputs, expected effects, and failpoints. Canonical JSON is
UTF-8 with lexicographically sorted object keys and no optional whitespace.
The publication verifier independently derives that identity and validates all
named control-result hashes against their live artifacts.

The result fixture's `scenario_hash` is a different identity: it is the raw
SHA-256 digest of the complete `CONTROL-SCENARIO.json` bytes, including
formatting and the embedded `scenario_id`. It binds the exact published file.
The content-derived `scenario_id` identifies scenario semantics under the
versioned StableId construction; neither value substitutes for the other.

The containing Git commit is intentionally not embedded in either manifest.
Exact-head review publication and the post-merge receipt bind that commit
externally, avoiding a circular hash.
