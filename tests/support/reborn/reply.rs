//! `RebornScriptedReply` — the terse façade for scripting one model turn in a
//! Reborn integration test. Each reply maps 1:1 to a `TraceStep`, auto-filling
//! id/tokens/request_hint/expected_tool_results so a test body needs exactly one
//! line per model turn. Raw `TraceStep`/`LlmTrace`/`TraceResponse` construction
//! is forbidden in new Reborn integration tests (design §4.2) — use this.

// Shared integration-test support: `support_unit_tests.rs` mounts the
// `reborn_support` tree without consuming this module, so its symbols read as
// dead there under `-D warnings`. Module-level allow matches the sibling
// support modules (`assertions.rs`, `test_channel.rs`).
