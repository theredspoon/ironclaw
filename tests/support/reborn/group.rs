//! Shared-persistence group infrastructure for Reborn integration tests.
//!
//! A **group** owns shared storage (composite filesystem, product workflow
//! harness, capability backend) AND one shared turn runtime (coordinator +
//! scheduler) exactly once; each [`RebornIntegrationGroup::thread`] call builds
//! a per-thread workflow (binding + inbound service + scripted-gateway
//! registration) over that one shared runtime. Within one group, state written
//! by thread A is visible to thread B — the key e2e persistence contract.
//!
//! Separate groups are separate test binaries and run in parallel, fully
//! isolated. A single-shot [`RebornIntegrationHarness::test_default()`] is a
//! degenerate one-thread group (its own storage, baseline = 0), so all
//! existing tests are byte-identical after this refactor.
//!
//! ## Group test binary layout
//!
//! ```text
//! tests/reborn_group_approvals/
//!     main.rs                         // one #[tokio::test], drives scenarios in order
//!     scenario_gate_then_resolve.rs   // pub async fn run(g:&RebornIntegrationGroup)->HarnessResult<()>
//!     scenario_approve_always_persists.rs
//! ```
//!
//! ### Why one sequential `#[tokio::test]`, not N separate `#[test]` fns
//!
//! Cargo does not guarantee order or share an instance between multiple
//! `#[test]` fns in one binary, and `serial_test` + global statics are
//! fragile.  One orchestrating fn is the only design that gives deterministic
//! ordering over a shared group instance without fragile machinery.
//!
//! ### Scenario shape
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! // scenario_approve_always_persists.rs
//! use crate::reborn_support::group::HarnessResult;
//! pub async fn run(g: &super::reborn_support::group::RebornIntegrationGroup)
//!     -> HarnessResult<()>
//! {
//!     // ... build thread, submit turn, assert ...
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Use `?` for *dependent* scenarios (failure stops the driver) and
//! `report.record(name, scenario::run(&g).await)` for *independent* ones
//! (failure recorded, others continue).
//!
//! ### Subdir module paths
//!
//! Each group `main.rs` MUST declare BOTH `#[path]` overrides, each with
//! `#[allow(dead_code)]`:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! #[allow(dead_code)] #[path = "../support/reborn/mod.rs"] mod reborn_support;
//! #[allow(dead_code)] #[path = "../support/mod.rs"] mod support;
//! ```
//!
//! Bare `mod support;` resolves to `tests/reborn_group_*/support.rs` (which
//! does not exist) and fails to compile.
//!
//! ### Two composites — use the right one
//!
//! - [`RebornIntegrationGroup::turn_composite`]: thread/turn history read-back.
//! - [`RebornIntegrationGroup::capability_harness`]: capability stores
//!   (memory, projects, extensions, secrets, approval/auto-approve).
//!
//! Do NOT read memory or approval state from `turn_composite()` — the
//! host-runtime capability stores live in a **separate** filesystem inside
//! the `HostRuntimeCapabilityHarness`, not in the integration composite.

// Shared by all group test binaries; symbols read as dead when a binary
// does not exercise every variant.
#![allow(dead_code)]
