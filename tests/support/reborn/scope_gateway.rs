//! Scope-routing gateway for Reborn group integration tests.
//!
//! `ScopeRegistryGateway` multiplexes model calls to per-thread scripted
//! gateways by `TurnScope`. The loop-driver host calls
//! `resolve_for_scope(&scope)` at host-construction time (not on the model
//! hot path) and wraps the returned gateway in
//! `ThreadResolvingLoopModelGateway`. The registry's own `stream_model` is
//! therefore **never called** when routing succeeds; it exists only to satisfy
//! the trait contract and fails **loudly** so a routing miss (unregistered
//! scope) surfaces as `ConfigurationError` rather than masking as the original
//! flake.
//!
//! ## Invariant
//! This dispatcher sits at the `HostManagedModelGateway` seam but routes to
//! REAL `LlmProviderModelGateway` instances over the `ironclaw_llm` decorator
//! chain. The single-fake-at-the-vendor-SDK-seam invariant (CLAUDE.md §5–8,
//! §28) is preserved: the only fake is the `TraceLlm` at the bottom of each
//! registered gateway's chain, not this dispatcher.

// Shared by all group test binaries; symbols read as dead when a binary
// does not exercise every variant.
