//! `RebornIntegrationHarness` — the integration test tier that runs the full
//! internal Reborn stack and intercepts the model at the vendor-SDK seam.
//!
//! Unlike `RebornBinaryE2EHarness` (which swaps the whole `HostManagedModelGateway`
//! with `RebornTraceReplayModelGateway`), this tier wires the REAL
//! `LlmProviderModelGateway` over the REAL `ironclaw_llm` decorator chain
//! (`apply_decorator_chain`, hermetic passthrough) and only scripts the raw
//! provider underneath via `TraceLlm`. A turn therefore exercises model-profile
//! resolution, `CompletionRequest`/tool-definition assembly, and the
//! retry/routing/circuit/cache decorators for real.
//!
//! Slice 1 scope: InMemory storage, single text reply, `build → submit_turn →
//! assert_reply_contains`.
//! Slice 3: `StorageMode { InMemory, LibSql }` — the builder defaults to
//! `InMemory`; `.storage(StorageMode::LibSql)` selects a real SQLite file in a
//! per-`build()` `TempDir`. Both modes ride **one** `CompositeRootFilesystem`
//! at `/tenants/...` so thread history and turn state share the same backend
//! and the same production path layout.

// Shared integration-test support: not every binary that mounts the
// `reborn_support` tree consumes this module — `support_unit_tests.rs` mounts
// the tree to run the support unit tests but exercises none of the slice-1/2
// integration harness, so its symbols read as dead there under `-D warnings`.
// Module-level allow matches `assertions.rs`/`test_channel.rs`/`live_mission_helpers.rs`.
