//! Integration tests for #3045: the visible capability surface filter
//! must be invoked from the model-facing tool list path so a regression
//! that bypasses it is caught at the integration tier — not just in unit
//! tests on `runtime_filter::is_visible_under` itself.
//!
//! This is zmanian's gap #3 ("binding test that
//! `runtime_filter::is_visible_under` is actually called from the
//! model-facing tool-list path"). We register the shell tool, build the
//! tool definitions through the same `ToolRegistry` method the
//! dispatcher invokes (`tool_definitions_visible_under(policy)`), and
//! assert that:
//!
//! - Under a `LocalDev` policy that resolves to `LocalHost`, shell is
//!   visible.
//! - Under a `HostedDev` policy that resolves to `TenantSandbox`, shell
//!   is hidden — the security-property assertion that the issue's
//!   acceptance criterion calls out ("Hosted multi-tenant surfaces omit
//!   provider-host filesystem and LocalHost shell affordances entirely").
//!
//! We also drive the resolver from a `RuntimeConfig` shape that mirrors
//! the production `Config::with_runtime_overrides` call site, so a
//! regression that decouples the resolver from the dispatcher tool list
//! shows up here as a real failure.
