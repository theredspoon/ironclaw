//! Scenario: two distinct actors, each on their own thread, both complete a
//! turn over the group's ONE shared runtime (Option P, #5465).
//!
//! FIX-5479 / E-MULTIUSER: the shared runtime resolves each turn's thread
//! through a per-turn owner-scope rewrite (`ThreadScopeResolver::
//! resolve_for_turn`, the same mechanism production already uses for
//! multi-user WebChat) rather than a construction-time-fixed owner. Before
//! the fix, any actor other than the group's canonical default actor failed
//! deterministically with `driver_unavailable` / "unknown thread".
