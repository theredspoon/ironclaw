//! C-MULTIUSER scenario: per-actor AUTO-APPROVE (always-allow) isolation. The
//! always-allow toggle is keyed on the run owner's `(tenant, user)` scope
//! (`AutoApproveSettingKey`), read at capability dispatch — a grant made for
//! actor A's owner must NOT let actor B's identical, otherwise-gated call
//! through. Covers both "approval-settings non-leak" and "auto-approve
//! non-leak", which are the SAME mechanic.
//!
//! Actor A grants always-allow for its own owner, then A's gated `write_file`
//! completes with NO gate. Actor B — a DISTINCT actor over the SAME shared
//! auto-approve store — issues the IDENTICAL call and still raises a real
//! `BlockedApproval` gate, because A's grant is scoped to A's owner alone.
//!
//! Seam: `RebornIntegrationGroup::multiuser_approvals` builds the file-approval
//! backend with `with_run_owner_scoped_capability_dispatch`, keying dispatch
//! (auto-approve lookup, approval request, gate evidence) on each actor's OWN
//! owner — matching production, where the run owner IS the capability user.
