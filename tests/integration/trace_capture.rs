//! C-TRACECAP enabler (c): production trace-capture sink on the int-tier lane.
//!
//! Wires the REAL `TraceCaptureTurnEventSink` (via composition's
//! `test_support::trace_capture_turn_event_sink_for_test`, mirroring
//! `build_reborn_runtime`'s recipe) into the group's ONE planned runtime with
//! `.with_trace_capture()`, and proves the capture path end-to-end: policy
//! read → transcript capture → redact → score → queue
//! (`ironclaw_reborn_traces::contribution`, previously 0% on the lane).
//!
//! Enrollment divergence from the plan (verified infeasible as written): a
//! scripted `builtin.trace_commons.onboard` with `confirmed=true` can NEVER
//! enroll against a canned recording-egress body — the onboarding client
//! cross-checks the server-echoed `device_key_id` against a locally generated
//! ephemeral key (`onboarding/mod.rs:241`), which only a live echo-mock
//! issuer can satisfy (see `trace_commons_dispatch_e2e.rs`). The scenario
//! therefore (1) scripts onboard with `confirmed=false` through real
//! capability dispatch — the consent gate, which doubles as the
//! inert-until-enrolled control — and (2) enrolls by writing the SAME policy
//! state onboard writes (`write_trace_policy_for_scope`, the plan's original
//! fallback). Live-issuer onboarding stays a named follow-on with the other
//! network paths.
//!
//! This binary owns `IRONCLAW_BASE_DIR`: trace policy/queue paths resolve
//! through `ironclaw_common`'s process-wide `LazyLock`, so the tempdir env
//! var is set as the FIRST action, before any read (same pattern as
//! `crates/ironclaw_host_runtime/tests/trace_commons_dispatch_e2e.rs`).
//! Keep this suite a single sequenced `#[tokio::test]`: enrollment state is
//! process-global (per scope), so concurrent tests in this binary would race.
