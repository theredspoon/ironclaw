//! S2 — reopen-resume-through-gate (restart recovery mid-gate).
//!
//! User flow: a turn parks on an approval gate, the service restarts, the user
//! approves, and the run resumes and completes. Existing durability coverage
//! (`group_approvals::scenario_approval_request_persists_after_reopen`) proves
//! the approval-REQUEST record survives an independent reopen, but that
//! scenario runs over the default `StorageMode::InMemory` group — the turn/gate
//! STATE (`FilesystemTurnStateStore`, holding `TurnStatus::BlockedApproval` +
//! `GateRef`) is never independently reopened there. This test drives a
//! `StorageMode::LibSql` group so BOTH stores are genuinely on-disk, reopens
//! BOTH independently of the live group, then resumes to completion — the
//! missing half of the "harness-rebuild-over-storage-root" seam.
//!
//! Scope note: this reopens the on-disk STORES (turn-state + approval-request)
//! independently of the live process, mirroring `assert_reply_persists_after_reopen`'s
//! established idiom — it does not additionally tear down and rebuild the
//! `TurnCoordinator`/`TurnRunScheduler` themselves (that would require
//! duplicating `RebornIntegrationGroupBuilder::into_group`'s full ~150-line
//! production-composition wiring, including the product-workflow binding
//! service, as a second construction path — a materially larger enabler than
//! this pair; see `tests/integration/support/group.rs:601` for the wiring this
//! would need to duplicate). The resume itself uses the harness's existing
//! store-level `approve_gate` path; real-dispatch gate resolution is owned by
//! a parallel lane and is not duplicated here.
