//! C-BUDGET (wiring-liveness only): the harness bypass path
//! (`build_default_planned_runtime`) wires the PRODUCTION
//! `build_default_budget_accountant` into `DefaultPlannedRuntimeParts::model_budget_accountant`,
//! and that accountant fires on a real coordinator-path turn.
//!
//! Budget SEMANTICS (ledger, thresholds, approval-unblock, `BudgetEvent`
//! cascade) are covered at crate tier via `build_reborn_runtime`
//! (`budget_e2e.rs` / `budget_approval_e2e.rs`) — not re-authored here. This
//! proves only that the accountant is live: on the turn's first model call it
//! seeds the run owner's daily USD cap, observable via the in-memory governor.
