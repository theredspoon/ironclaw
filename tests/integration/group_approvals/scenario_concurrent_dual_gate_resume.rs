//! HEADLINE scenario for Option P: two threads simultaneously parked on the
//! group's ONE shared `TurnCoordinator`, resolved independently with opposite
//! dispositions, asserting resume is dispatched by `run_id` and neither run's
//! resume disturbs the other's pending gate or terminal state.
//!
//! Scope: `GroupSharedStorage` gives the whole group ONE workspace root, so
//! this does NOT prove per-thread workspace isolation — confirmed
//! empirically: an added `thread_b.assert_workspace_file_absent("concurrent_a.txt")`
//! check failed because A's write is visible through B's handle on the
//! shared workspace. Only resume-by-`run_id` is asserted here.
//!
//! New scenario needed (consolidate-don't-proliferate, CLAUDE.md "Testing
//! Discipline"): the sibling gate scenarios resolve one thread's gate before
//! the next submits, so at most one run is ever `Blocked` at a time — that
//! can't distinguish "resume keys on `run_id`" from "resume keys on
//! registration order". This scenario puts two runs in `Blocked` state on
//! the shared coordinator SIMULTANEOUSLY, then resolves them with opposite
//! dispositions.
