//! Scenario: a gated `builtin.write_file` raises a real `BlockedApproval` gate;
//! denying it resumes the run so the model sees a non-retryable authorization
//! failure (not a hang) and finalizes a reply.
//!
//! Real path: gate fires → `deny_gate` (real `ApprovalResolver::deny`, no lease)
//! → `coordinator.resume_turn` with `GateResumeDisposition::Denied` → the
//! executor surfaces an authorization failure to the model → the model finalizes
//! its reply → terminal.
