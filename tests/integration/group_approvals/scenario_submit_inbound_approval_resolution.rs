//! Scenario: a gated `builtin.write_file` call raises a real `BlockedApproval`
//! gate; resolving it via a REAL `submit_inbound(ApprovalResolution)` (the
//! literal dispatch arm a product adapter's "approve"/"deny" reply hits)
//! resumes the run — not `approve_gate`/`deny_gate`'s direct
//! `TurnCoordinator::resume_turn` shortcut. Requires the group to be built
//! with `.with_real_gate_dispatch_services()`, which wires the REAL
//! `ApprovalInteractionService` over the group's own shared turn-state store.
//!
//! Real path: scripted tool call → first-party runtime → `PermissionMode::Ask`
//! with auto-approve OFF → `TurnStatus::BlockedApproval` → real
//! `ApprovalInteractionService::resolve` (via `DefaultProductWorkflow::submit_inbound`)
//! → `coordinator.resume_turn` → the gated capability re-dispatches (approve)
//! or the run finalizes an authorization failure (deny).
