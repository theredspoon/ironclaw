//! C-DURABLE: a pending approval request survives an independent reopen of
//! the approval-request store at the SAME on-disk local-dev `storage_root` —
//! proving approval state persists to disk, not just in memory. Parallels
//! `assert_reply_persists_after_reopen` (thread history) and
//! `reborn_integration_durable.rs` (extension installs).
//!
//! Raises a real `BlockedApproval` gate, reopens a FRESH `ApprovalRequestStore`
//! at the same root, and asserts the `Pending` record is there independent of
//! the live `Arc` the running group holds, then resolves the gate normally.
