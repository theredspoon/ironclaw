//! Part 2a (#5466 / F-CAS-CONTENTION): real `tokio::join!` parallel pressure
//! against the group's ONE shared CAS turn-state store
//! (`FilesystemTurnStateStore` over `InMemoryBackend` -- the same concrete
//! CAS-over-`RootFilesystem` mechanism prod uses, independent of
//! `StorageMode`). Sibling of `scenario_concurrent_dual_gate_resume.rs`,
//! whose own module doc explicitly defers this: "truly parallel
//! read-modify-write turns against the shared CAS turn-state store is a
//! separate, prod-relevant concern orthogonal to what this scenario proves."
//!
//! #5466 measured ~10% of single-attempt real-parallel exchanges landing on
//! a sanitized `exit_application_failed` catch-all instead of `Completed`,
//! root-caused to `FilesystemTurnStateStore`'s lock-free CAS retry churning
//! a fresh libsql connection per attempt under concurrent contention (see
//! `crates/ironclaw_turns/src/filesystem_store.rs`'s `cas_update`). #5751
//! fixed the root cause with a bounded deadpool connection pool. Verified
//! here (cycle-3 fix lane, PR #5819): 50 real `StorageMode::LibSql` runs and
//! 40 `InMemory` runs, 0 failures and 0 tolerated-flake occurrences in
//! either -- both the libsql exclusion and the retry-tolerance this
//! scenario used to need are retired.
