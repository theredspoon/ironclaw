//! Group integration tests for cross-thread memory persistence.
//!
//! A [`RebornIntegrationGroup`] owns one shared `HostRuntimeCapabilityHarness`
//! (one filesystem, one memory backend). State written by thread A is visible
//! to thread B because both share the same underlying store — the whole point.
//!
//! One sequential `#[tokio::test]`: a shared group instance can't split across
//! Cargo test cases without fragile global state, and each scenario's
//! writer must complete before its reader/searcher/lister runs. Scenarios seed
//! their own data, so ordering between them doesn't matter.
