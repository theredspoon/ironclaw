//! Permutation 3 — multi-actor journey: turn 1 is actor A, a subsequent turn is
//! actor B (via `with_actor_id`), each hitting its OWN approval gate over the
//! group's ONE shared coordinator. Pins that gate resolution + resume state stay
//! bound to the RAISING actor's turn: approving A's gate does NOT resolve B's,
//! and B still blocks on its own gate, resolved independently under B's actor.
//!
//! Runs on `RebornIntegrationGroup::multiuser_approvals()` (C-MULTIUSER
//! `scope_capability_by_run_owner` harness seam), which scopes each actor's
//! gated write to ITS OWN run owner so actor B's dispatch doesn't die with
//! `driver_protocol_violation` under actor A's user.
//!
//! Complementary to (not a duplicate of): `reborn_group_approvals`'s
//! `concurrent_dual_gate_resume` (SAME actor, two threads parked simultaneously)
//! and `reborn_group_multiuser`'s `two_actors_own_threads` (distinct actors, NO
//! gate). This is distinct-actor × gate-resolution-binding — the axis neither
//! covers.
