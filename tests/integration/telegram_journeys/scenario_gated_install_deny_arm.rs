/// Ben's regression (2026-07-16): a paired user DMed the bot "can you
/// install slack" and the conversation HUNG — the run parked on slack's
/// OAuth setup gate, and with `TelegramDeliveryProtocol::post_status_message`
/// unwired in v1 every host-authored notice (working message, blocked-run
/// action-needed prompt, busy hints) silently failed, so the DM saw nothing
/// and follow-up messages produced nothing. This pins the fixed contract:
///
/// 1. a paired DM asking for a slack install runs the REAL
///    `builtin.extension_install` + `builtin.extension_activate` capabilities;
///    slack's activation gates on its personal-OAuth credential requirement;
/// 2. the DM RECEIVES host-authored feedback about the gate (via the wired
///    `sendMessage` status path — never silence);
/// 3. the channel is not wedged: a follow-up DM still gets host feedback.
///
/// Covers (docs/qa/telegram-coverage-map.md): the cross-extension in-DM
/// install/gate rows of qa-telegram Conversations + the deferred-busy
/// feedback rows of Telegram Failure and Recovery.
