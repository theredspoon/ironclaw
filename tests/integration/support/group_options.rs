//! Runtime-wiring setters for [`RebornIntegrationGroupBuilder`] — `storage`,
//! `safety_context`, `with_turn_event_sink`, `with_trace_capture`,
//! `with_tool_disclosure_bridged`, `with_tool_disclosure_off`, `budget_accounting`,
//! `communication_context_provider`, `hook_dispatcher_builder_factory`.
//! Private child module of `group.rs` (owns the struct + `build_base`/
//! `into_group`), so it reaches the builder's private fields at module-
//! private visibility instead of widening them to `pub(crate)`. New builder
//! setters belong HERE.

// Shared by all group test binaries; symbols read as dead when a binary does
// not exercise every setter (mirrors the same attribute on `group.rs`/
// `group_constructors.rs`).
