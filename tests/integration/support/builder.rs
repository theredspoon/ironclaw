//! `RebornIntegrationHarness` — the integration test tier that runs the full
//! internal Reborn stack and intercepts the model at the vendor-SDK seam.
//!
//! Unlike `RebornBinaryE2EHarness` (swaps the whole `HostManagedModelGateway`),
//! this tier wires the REAL `LlmProviderModelGateway` over the REAL
//! `ironclaw_llm` decorator chain and only scripts the raw provider underneath
//! via `TraceLlm` — a turn exercises model-profile resolution, request/tool-def
//! assembly, and the retry/routing/circuit/cache decorators for real.
//!
//! `StorageMode { InMemory, LibSql }` — defaults to `InMemory`;
//! `.storage(StorageMode::LibSql)` selects a real SQLite file in a
//! per-`build()` `TempDir`. Both ride **one** `CompositeRootFilesystem` at
//! `/tenants/...` so thread history and turn state share the same backend.

// Shared integration-test support: not every binary that mounts the
// `reborn_support` tree consumes this module — `support_unit_tests.rs` mounts
// the tree to run the support unit tests but exercises none of the slice-1/2
// integration harness, so its symbols read as dead there under `-D warnings`.
// Module-level allow matches `assertions.rs`/`test_channel.rs`/`live_mission_helpers.rs`.
