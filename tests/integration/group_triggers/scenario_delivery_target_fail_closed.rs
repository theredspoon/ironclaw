//! Per-trigger delivery routing fails closed at the int tier: a
//! `builtin.trigger_create` carrying a `delivery_target_id` is rejected as
//! invalid input on a host with NO outbound delivery target providers
//! registered (this harness), and nothing is persisted.
//!
//! The ACCEPT path (a host that can resolve outbound targets) is covered at
//! the dispatch tier with a validating hook
//! (`builtin_trigger_create_with_delivery_target_persists_it_when_host_validates`,
//! `crates/ironclaw_host_runtime/tests/first_party_builtin_tools.rs`) and at
//! the composition tier against the real Slack provider + registry
//! (`slack_delivery.rs` driver tests,
//! `factory.rs::trigger_delivery_target_validation_resolves_through_the_outbound_registry`).
//! This harness deliberately wires no outbound-target provider — wiring one
//! here would be test-only wiring for a path production wires via
//! `build_slack_host_beta_mounts` — so the int tier owns the fail-closed arm.
