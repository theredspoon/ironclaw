//! Scenario pair: a TRIGGERED run (real `TrustedTriggerFireSubmitter` origin,
//! `TurnOriginKind::ScheduledTrigger`) raises a real `BlockedApproval` gate
//! mid-fire; the creator approves (or denies) and the run resumes to terminal.
//!
//! Mirrors `reborn_group_approvals/scenario_gate_then_{approve,deny}.rs`, but
//! the gated turn arrives through the trusted-trigger submit wire
//! (`submit_triggered_turn_scripted`) instead of the interactive
//! `submit_turn_until_blocked` — pinning that trigger-origin runs raise, park
//! on, and resume from approval gates exactly like interactive runs (nothing
//! in the scheduled_trigger surface/deny-map (#5505) suppresses the
//! `builtin.write_file` Ask gate; only trigger mutator verbs are stripped).
//!
//! Each arm builds its OWN `live_approvals` group: the two fires would
//! otherwise interleave one shared script and one shared approval store,
//! making gate/coverage attribution ambiguous.
