//! C-JOURNEY (triggered-origin): a triggered fire whose run raises a real
//! `BlockedApproval` gate, gets resolved, then CHAINS into a SECOND
//! `BlockedApproval` gate in the SAME run — pins that `TurnOriginKind::
//! ScheduledTrigger` survives BOTH resume hops, not just the first.
//!
//! Distinct from `scenario_triggered_gate::run_approve` (ONE gate, single
//! resume hop): this scripts THREE model calls so the run parks TWICE, and
//! reads `state.product_context.origin` at both parks AND at final
//! `Completed` — closing the gap where origin regresses only on the second hop.
