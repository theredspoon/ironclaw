//! Reborn integration-test framework — slice 8: OAuth credential-refresh sweep.
//!
//! Proves the proactive keepalive sweep refreshes an idle Google OAuth account
//! with the token-refresh HTTP scripted through `ScriptedOAuthTokenEgress` (no
//! real network) and real credential stores on a `FilesystemAuthProductServices
//! <InMemoryBackend>` composite.
//!
//! Clock injection (`now: DateTime<Utc>` parameter on `sweep_once`) lets a test
//! freeze time 3 days ahead so a just-created account appears idle without an
//! actual wait.  Design spec §9 build-order, step 8.

// The support tree is large and shared; a single-test file exercises only a
// slice of it, so suppress dead-code warnings on the includes.
