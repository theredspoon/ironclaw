//! W5-WIRING-PARITY (issue #5637): the harness's `DefaultPlannedRuntimeParts`
//! construction (`support/group.rs`'s `into_group`) stays field-Some/None-
//! identical to production's local-dev construction
//! (`ironclaw_reborn_composition::runtime::build_reborn_runtime`), modulo a
//! named allowlist of deliberate test-double substitutions — so a new
//! port/field lands loud instead of silently drifting. Zero production-crate
//! edits: the mechanism is entirely test-side.
//!
//! **Scope, by design**: this compares Some/None SHAPE only, never field
//! VALUES; only the local-dev/local-dev-yolo production profile (never
//! `Production`/`HostedSingleTenant*`); never `DefaultPlannedRuntimeConfig`'s
//! inner fields. Known accepted gap: it also cannot detect a silent
//! value-preserving rewiring of an *existing* field in production — only
//! added/removed fields and harness regressions on already-tracked fields.
//!
//! A companion, unrelated check lives in the same file: every
//! `harness/profiles/*.rs` domain's `capability_ids` — read from that
//! domain's REAL `ToolsProfile`/harness constructor, never a hand-copied
//! table — is a subset of production's real capability surface
//! (`builtin_first_party_package()` + the github/bundled-extension
//! manifest-derived id sets), modulo a skip-list of deliberately synthetic
//! local-dev-only ids. See `production_capability_surface()`'s doc for one
//! known, deliberately-excluded gap (the extension-lifecycle ids) that is
//! visibility-blocked rather than papered over.
