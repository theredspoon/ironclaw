# Guard the tests/integration/ (coverage-bearing, roadmap-integration) vs
# tests/reborn_*.rs + tests/support/reborn_parity_qa/ (parity/QA, NOT
# coverage-bearing) suite boundary established by the restructure that moved
# the roadmap integration suite to tests/integration/ (see
# docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-26-reborn-integration-test-framework-design.md
# and the git history under tests/integration/).
#
# The direction is one-way: tests/reborn_*.rs parity/QA bins MAY reuse
# tests/integration/support/ (the roadmap harness), but tests/integration/
# suites must NEVER depend back on the parity/QA support tree — that would
# silently pull QA-only fixtures/harness weight into the suites this repo's
# coverage report is scoped to, and would resurrect exactly the coupling the
# restructure split apart.
#
# Checks:
#   1. Direction guard — no file under tests/integration/ mentions the
#      parity/QA support tree (by its local module alias `parity_qa_support`
#      or its mount path `support/reborn_parity_qa/`).
#   2. Partition guard — every tests/reborn_*.rs bin that references one of
#      the 6 parity/QA modules (binary_e2e, model_replay, qa_trace,
#      qa_scenarios, delivery, network — see tests/support/reborn_parity_qa/
#      mod.rs) via its `parity_qa_support::` alias must declare the
#      `#[path = "support/reborn_parity_qa/mod.rs"]` mount; and no file under
#      tests/integration/ may declare that mount (redundant with #1's path
#      check, kept as an explicit, separately-named assertion per the mount
#      itself rather than the module names).
#   3. Regression guard — tests/support/reborn/ (the pre-restructure location,
#      superseded by tests/support/reborn_parity_qa/) must not reappear.
#
# Exits non-zero with one message per violation (all checks run before
# exiting, so a single invocation reports every violation found, not just the
# first).
