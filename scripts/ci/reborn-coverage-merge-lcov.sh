# Merge N per-lane lcov tracefiles from the Reborn integration-tier coverage
# lanes (.github/workflows/reborn-tests.yml's `reborn-integration-coverage`
# matrix — 4 flat partitions + 1 group lane, each producing its lcov via one
# combined `cargo llvm-cov ... test --lcov` invocation) into one deterministic tracefile, filtered to `crates/ironclaw_*`
# source files.
#
# Every lane instruments the SAME workspace build, so the same source file can
# appear in more than one lane's tracefile with different per-line hit counts
# (each lane only exercised its own subset of test binaries against that
# shared file). A naive concatenation would leave duplicate `SF:` blocks for
# that file instead of one true picture of "how many of the 5 lanes hit this
# line" — so this script sums DA: hit counts per (file, line) across all
# inputs and recomputes LF/LH from the merged counts, rather than trusting any
# single lane's LF/LH.
#
# Deliberately a small Python merger, not the `lcov` CLI (`lcov -a ... -o`):
# avoids an extra apt-get dependency in the coverage-report job (see
# scripts/ci/install-ci-apt-packages.sh for that pattern, used elsewhere) and
# keeps this fully testable locally without installing anything.
#
# Usage:
#   reborn-coverage-merge-lcov.sh <output.lcov> <input1.lcov> [input2.lcov ...]
