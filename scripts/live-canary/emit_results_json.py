"""Scrape `cargo test --nocapture` output into a results.json file that
notify_slack.py::parse_results_json can already consume.

Invoked from scripts/live-canary/run.sh at the end of every cargo-based
lane. Skipped (early-exits as no-op) when:

  * --out already exists — workflow-canary writes its own results.json
    via scripts/workflow_canary/run_workflow_canary.py, and that file
    must not be overwritten.
  * The log contains no `test result:` line — auth-* lanes use pytest +
    JUnit XML and produce no cargo-style output, so there is nothing to
    scrape.

Schema matches the workflow-canary contract (see parse_results_json):

    {"results": [
        {"provider": "...", "mode": "<test_name>",
         "success": bool, "latency_ms": int,
         "details": {"error": "<short panic msg>"}},
        ...
    ]}

We only emit one entry per executed test (cargo `ok` or `FAILED`).
`ignored` tests are not results — they didn't run — so they are skipped
entirely.

Per-test latency is unknowable from cargo's plain stdout, so we leave
``latency_ms`` at 0 and put the lane-level wall-clock duration on a
single ``meta`` entry consumed only by future tooling. notify_slack.py
sums ``latency_ms`` per entry so the 0 values are harmless — lane-level
duration is captured by the workflow itself.

# only via the generic `api_key=…` / `"api_key": "…"` assignment shapes
# below — same gap as scrub-artifacts.sh, documented so nobody assumes
# a bare Composio token survives.
#
# Order matters: Anthropic (`sk-ant-…`) is matched before the broader
# OpenAI `sk-…` rule so an Anthropic key gets the correct label. The
# OpenAI pattern also uses a negative lookahead as belt-and-braces in
